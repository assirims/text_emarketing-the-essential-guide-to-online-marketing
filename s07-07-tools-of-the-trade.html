    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p01">Affiliate marketing today forms a fundamental part of most e-retailers’ strategies. So what tools does a merchant need to have a successful program?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p02">Any retailer should have a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product feed</a><span class="glossdef">A way of providing information about the products on a merchant’s Web site in a way that breaks up the information easily, and is standardized. A product feed will be either XML (extensible markup language) or CSV (comma-separated values) and will probably contain the following information for each product: product name, product URL (uniform resource locator), product picture, product price, description, shipping price, and stock status.</span></span>, either XML (extensible markup language) or CSV (comma-separated values). A product feed is a way to provide information about the products on a merchant’s Web site in a way that breaks up the information easily and is standardized. A product feed will probably contain the following information for each product:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_l02">
        <li>Product name</li>

        <li>Stock status</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p03">Affiliates, particularly search affiliates, can use this to promote individual products.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p04">A product feed is made available on a simple URL and displays content that affiliates can use in their campaigns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p05">Merchants need to create a set of banners and buttons that can be placed on affiliate Web sites. At a minimum, the following sizes should be available:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_l03">
        <li>468 × 60 (banner)</li>
        <li>125 × 125 (square)</li>
        <li>120 × 60 (button)</li>
        <li>120 × 600 (skyscraper)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p06">Having interactive banners, such as gift wizards or product searches, means that potential customers can interact with the brand before they even come through to the merchant’s Web site.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p07">If the merchant or the affiliate network hosts the banners, the banners can be updated without the affiliates having to do anything. This means that the message can be kept current across all the merchant campaigns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p08">Merchants need to consider who will be <strong class="emphasis bold">keeping tabs on and driving the success of</strong> the affiliate campaign. Merchants might be able to run the program in-house with current staffing resources or can hire an affiliate manager. It is also possible to outsource the management of the affiliate program to an agency that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_p09">Lastly, merchants need to <strong class="emphasis bold">keep in touch</strong> with their affiliates the networks have channels for communicating with a large number of affiliates, but it is also worthwhile to interact on some of the affiliate marketing forums in order to keep informed.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Tools Does an Affiliate Need?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_s02_p01">Affiliates need to get to grips with <strong class="emphasis bold">the spectrum of eMarketing tactics</strong>, and choose what works best for them. Paid search affiliates will focus on PPC (pay-per-click) tactics, while affiliates running custom-made Web sites will probably put a lot of energy into SEO (search engine optimization). It depends on where their talent lies and where they see a gap in the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch04_s07_s02_p02">For affiliates, keeping up to date with merchants, other affiliates, and the industry is probably the key to growth.
