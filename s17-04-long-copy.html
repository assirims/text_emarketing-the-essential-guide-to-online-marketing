    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_p01">Online copywriting is not just about short, sharp, call-to-action copy; however, Web users tend to scan pages quickly to determine whether or not they will read further. Even when writing longer copy, you need to take this into consideration.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_p02">Longer online copy allows you to foster a relationship with a reader, whether it is on a blog, through e-mail communications, or through articles and news releases. With more words and space available to use, you are able to establish a voice and a personality to make your copy more convincing and personal.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Read: Titles and Subject Lines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Titles and subject lines are there for a very important reason: they inform readers whether or not they are likely to want to read further by giving a sneak preview into what is to come in the article. They are the gateway to your content.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p02">Consider the following two titles:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Guide to Online Copywriting</li>
            <li>Ten Steps to Writing Online Copy That Sells</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p03">The second title conveys more information to the reader that helps the reader decide to read further. Minor word manipulation that tells the reader how he or she will benefit from reading that content can make a huge difference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p04">Subject lines are like titles for e-mails and can make the difference between an e-mail being deleted instantly and being opened and read. Subject lines also work hand in hand with the “from” field of an e-mail. Both fields usually appear side by side in an in-box and are used to determine relevance, familiarity, and trust.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p05">Use a consistent and easy-to-recognize <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sender alias</a><span class="glossdef">The name that is chosen to appear in the sender or “from” field of an e-mail.</span></span>—the “from” field—so that readers can recognize your e-mails easily. With familiarity and trust established using this field, the subject line can be used more creatively, allowing you to build on the already-established relationships with your readers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p06">As with a title, use the subject line to make clear what the e-mail is about. For example, if there is a promotion in the e-mail, consider putting it in the subject line as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p07">Titles, headlines, and subject lines need to be both persuasive and enticing. Consider what need your copy is meeting for your readers and express that first. Be honest and straightforward and never misrepresent the content of an e-mail as this will prevent readers from opening them in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Copywriting for Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p01">As well as the copy on the Web page, HTML (hypertext markup language) tags and metadata are also used by a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine optimization (SEO)</a><span class="glossdef">Aiming to improve rankings in search engines.</span></span> copywriter. In addition to assisting you with structuring your content, these tags indicate relevancy and context to search engines. Some of the tags are used by screenreaders, and so they assist visitors with disabilities to access your content. The meta description can also be used by search engines on the search engine results pages (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SERPs</a><span class="glossdef">What you see when you perform a search on a search engine.</span></span>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p02">A keyword refers to the word or words that are used in a search query on a search engine. Multiword keywords are sometimes referred to as key phrases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p03">The first step in SEO copywriting is <strong class="emphasis bold">keyword research</strong>. Having identified the themes of your Web site and Web pages, keyword research should be used to identify what keywords your target audience uses when searching for you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p04">Each page should be optimized for a primary key phrase and can be optimized for a secondary and tertiary key phrase as well. Usually a Web page is optimized for three key phrases but can be optimized for up to five (though only if the page is very long). Any more than that and you are better off creating new, niche Web pages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p05">In <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch06#fwk-105454-ch06">Chapter 6 "Search Engine Optimization"</a>, there is more detail on the process of keyword discovery and keyword selection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p06">The following are guidelines for using key phrases on a Web page:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p07">Remember that each page on a Web site must have a unique URL (uniform resource locator), title, meta keywords, and meta description.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s02_p01">The main key phrase for the page should be used in the URL for the page. Often, the URL is generated from the page title, so using the key phrase in the page title should ensure that it is in the URL as well. This also helps readers to glance at the URL and get an idea what they are reading about.</p>
        </div>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s03_p01">The page title appears at the top of a user’s browser and should be able to tell the user (and the search engine spiders, of course) what the main theme of the page is. The page title is limited to sixty-six characters (including spaces). The key phrase should be used as close to the beginning of the title as possible—keeping it relevant and interesting.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s04">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s04_p01">The meta description is a short paragraph describing the page content. This summary is usually shown on the SERPs if it contains the search term searched for, which means that it needs to entice users to click through. The spiders use the meta description to deduce the topic of the page, and the use of targeted key phrases is important here. Copy is limited to no more than 166 characters (including spaces).</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s04_p02">Keyword stuffing refers to putting too many keywords into the meta keywords’ tagging and using keywords that are not relevant to the Web page. Search engines can penalize this as a spam practice.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s05_p01">The meta keywords are a list of the words and phrases that are important on a Web page. The use of targeted key phrases is important here, but remember: no keyword stuffing. The meta keywords are limited to two hundred characters (including spaces). Take time to consider how to make this relevant as well as convincing enough to get a searcher to click on your page instead of your competitor’s.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p01">Spiders assign more relevance to the text used in headings, so it is important to use your key phrases in the headings on your page. It also helps to structure your content.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p02">Heading structures include the following:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p03">&lt;h1&gt;Page heading. What the page content is about&lt;/h1&gt;</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p06">Having a good heading hierarchy is important as spiders use it to move through your page. The hierarchy indicates what is more important and how the content is broken up. It also makes it easier for the reader to take in your content if it is arranged in a way that makes sense to her.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p01">The number of times you use the key phrases is entirely dependent on how long the page of copy is. You want to optimize the page for the key phrases without their use being overt.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p02">For SEO effectiveness, a page of Web copy should not be less than 250 words. On a 250-word page you could use the primary key phrase eight times (this includes use in metadata, headings, title, and body copy) and the secondary key phrase four times.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p04">The average Web page should not be so long that the user needs to scroll and scroll to get to the end of it. If you find the page is getting exceptionally long, consider breaking it into different sections. This way you could add more pages of optimized copy focused on one theme, instead of one very long page. This also allows for you to optimize pages for more keywords, targeting various search queries.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s08_p01">The text used to link from one page to another is considered important by the search engine spiders, so try to ensure that your key phrase is used when linking to the optimized page. The anchor text of links should include the key phrase of the page being linked to and not the page being linked from.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s09_p01">Alt text refers to the “alt” attribute for the IMG HTML (image HTML element) tag: this is the text that appears in the caption. It is used in HTML to attribute a text field to an image on a Web page, normally with a descriptive function, telling a user what an image is about and displaying the text in instances where the image is unable to load. While this is handy for readers, we also do it for another reason: search engine spiders can’t read images, but they can read the alt text. The image title tag is what shows when you hover with your mouse over an image and can also be read by the search engine spider. It also appears on a page where images may have been blocked or take time to load.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s10_p02">With new services and products being developed daily, it can feel like the list of new words, and the new ways to use words, is building faster than you can keep up with it. Dictionaries and reference guides celebrate this regularly with a “word of the year,” usually one that has been in heavy use by the Internet audience for the three years preceding its entrance into a dictionary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s10_p03">For example, in 2009, “unfriend” was voted the word of the year by the editors of the <em class="emphasis">New Oxford American Dictionary</em>, while “w00t” had its day in 2007 when it was featured on <em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster</em>’s selection for word of the year.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Things to Avoid</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s05_p01">Even if you are a brilliant copywriter, the moment you stop sticking to online copy rules and regulations, your writing will hold very little weight on the search engine. These are some of the examples of bad practice that can have some very serious repercussions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keyword stuffing</strong>. If you try to squash too many targeted phrases or keywords into a piece of copy, the search engine spiders will immediately pick this up, and you will stand the chance of being wiped right off the SERPs. Keyword stuffing makes copy sound forced and unnatural and is unpleasant to read. Stick to relevant content that offers the readers real value; this will naturally attract links and visitors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Misrepresented titles</strong>. Titles are often the first touch points that readers come across before deciding to pursue a page of copy. Therefore, they need to encompass what the page is about and get the gist of the content. Be sure to be true to your title; otherwise readers will feel cheated and taken advantage of and there is a strong chance that they will not want to visit again. Misrepresented titles breed mistrust—avoid this at all costs!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Irrelevant content</strong>. No reader wants to go through the mission of searching a search engine only to land on a page that has no relevance to him. Your content will be seen as waffle, and you will lose authority as a credible source—in fact, you will probably chase many visitors away.</li>

                <li>Copywriting for SEO involves optimizing copy for select key phrases in order to give context to search engines. A page can be optimized for up to five key phrases, but it is usually optimized for three of them. SEO copywriting involves the metadata and title tags, as well as the copy that is read on a page.</li>
                <li>The dynamic nature of the Internet means that new words are entering a user’s vocabulary every day. For best copywriting, know your audience and use the language that resonates most strongly with them.</li>
