The traffic to a landing page could be from a banner or PPC (pay-per-click) advertisement, an e-mail, a print advertisement, a television or radio spot, or direct marketing. Users are being sent there for a very specific reason, including the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_l02">
        <li>Enter a competition (lead)</li>
        <li>Buy a product (sale)</li>
        <li>Subscribe to a newsletter (sign-up)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_p02">As far as landing pages go, first impressions really do count. They need to capture the user immediately and make him want to complete the desired action. Users who land on these pages make the decision to complete the desired action based on two criteria:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_l03">
        <li>Whether the page looks complicated or time consuming</li>
        <li>Whether it is relevant to their needs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_p03">Effective design and benefit statements can help users to make the decision to complete the desired action.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Guidelines for Successful Landing Pages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_s02_p01">Focus the page on a single call to action. These are purpose-built, purpose-driven pages, and extraneous information should be avoided.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_s02_p02">The landing page does not need to carry the same navigation of the Web site and can look slightly different (though a large deviation in style is not advised). The aim is to keep users on a path to the goal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_s02_p03">Landing pages can detract from SEO (search engine optimization) efforts, as there might be many similar landing pages created. Use the robots.txt file to keep search engine spiders out.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_s02_p04">There are no cons to designing a Web site for your users first and foremost. It can require some creative thinking when it comes to ensuring that wacky ideas are accessible and usable, but the benefits of taking the time to ensure that Web sites are coded according to best practice will show in the longevity of the Web site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s05_s02_p05">Beautiful Web sites do not need to be sacrificed for standards compliance.</p>
