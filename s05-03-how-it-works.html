    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p01">If you consider marketing as communicating with current and potential customers, you will see that every e-mail that is sent from your organization should be considered as part of your holistic e-mail marketing strategy. Does that sound a little complicated? Consider an online retailer, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.zappos.com">http://www.zappos.com</a>. Zappos is an online shoe retailer. What are the ways that, as a customer, you might receive e-mails from Zappos?</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Transactional e-mails</strong>. When you place an order, there will be a number of e-mails that you receive, from confirmation of your order to notice of shipping. Should you need to return an item, you will no doubt communicate with Zappos via e-mail.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Newsletters</strong>. These are e-mails that are sent to provide information and keep customers informed. They do not necessarily carry an overt promotion but instead ensure that a customer is in regular contact with the brand. These build relationships and foster trust between customers and their chosen brands.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promotional e-mails</strong>. Should Zappos have a summer sale, they will send an e-mail relating directly to that promotion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p02">The following are examples of other e-mails sent by Zappos:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_l03">
        <li><strong class="emphasis bold">E-mails to suppliers</strong></li>
        <li><strong class="emphasis bold">Communication with affiliates</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p03">All the communication sent out can be used to convey your marketing message. Every touch point will market the organization. However, here we will focus on commercial e-mails.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p04">There are two types of commercial e-mails:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_l04">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Promotional e-mails</a><span class="glossdef">More direct and geared at enticing the user to take an immediate action.</span></span>. These are more direct and are geared at enticing the user to take an immediate action. They always feature a call to action and are designed around a specific goal.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Retention-based e-mails</a><span class="glossdef">Also referred to as newsletters, these may include promotional messages but should be focused on providing information of value to the user, geared at building a long-term relationship with the user.</span></span>.

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p05">As with all eMarketing activities, careful planning is called for, as is careful testing and evaluating, so as to optimize your revenue. E-mail marketing may be highly cost effective, but the cost of getting it wrong can be very high indeed.</p>
