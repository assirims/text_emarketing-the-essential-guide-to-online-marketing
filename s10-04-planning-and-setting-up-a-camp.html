    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_n01">

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_l01">
            <li>Know the steps needed to get a campaign up and running.</li>
            <li>Understand the importance of landing pages.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Do Your Homework</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s02_p01">For a successful campaign, you need a full online and an offline analysis of the business, customer demographics, the industry, and competitors. While it is relatively quick to set up a campaign, preplanning will show dividends later. You need a brand, an identity, and a clear, unique selling point. You only get three lines to advertise, so you need to make sure you know what should be in there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Define Your Goals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s03_p01">You need to know what you want to achieve with your PPC (pay-per-click) campaign. Branding campaigns, for example, are very different from campaigns that increase sales. What do you want users to do once they click on your advertisement?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Determine Your Budget, Cost per Action, and Targets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s04_p01">Determine how much you are willing to spend to achieve your goal—your target cost per action (CPA). Decide how much budget you are going to allocate to your PPC campaign. If your goal is to increase revenue, your budget might be unlimited so long as revenue is increasing and you are within your target CPA.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Research Keywords</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p01">You need to determine what keywords potential customers are likely to use when searching for the service that you offer. Along with that, you need to know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>What common misspellings a customer might use</li>
            <li>What words would show that they are not likely to purchase from you (words like free and cheap)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p02">As part of your keyword research, you need to look at expected volumes for your keywords, so you know how to bid on keywords. See “Tools of the Trade” in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch07_s05#fwk-105454-ch07_s05">Section 7.5 "Online Comparison Engines"</a> for some suggestions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p03">There are also tools that will show you similar or related keywords, so you can expand your keyword list even further. Again, find suggestions in “Tools of the Trade” in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch07_s05#fwk-105454-ch07_s05">Section 7.5 "Online Comparison Engines"</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 5: Write the Advertisements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06_p01">Using your keyword research, write compelling advertisements to promote your products. Advertisements can be unique to a keyword, or you can group them and have a number of keywords for one advertisement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06_p02">Make sure you use an appropriate display URL (uniform resource locator) and that you target the landing page for each advertisement. Always include a call to action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 6: Place Your Bids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s07_p01">Based on your goals and keyword research, set the maximum bids for your keywords. Don’t set these too high at this stage—you’ll tweak the bids as you test your campaign.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 7: Measure, Analyze, Test, Optimize!</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s08_p01">With conversion tracking in place, you can analyze your ROI (return on investment) down to a keyword level, and then focus on those keywords that are converting best. Consider seeing how changing the text of your advertisement can increase the CTR (click-through rate) or perhaps better your conversion rate. Test different landing pages to see what converts better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Landing Pages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p01">PPC advertising is not just about creating advertisements and bidding for keywords. The process continues once a user has clicked on your advertisement. The page that the user reaches by clicking on an advertisement is called a landing page.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p02">Landing pages can make or break an advertising campaign. Poorly executed PPC campaigns will send all users to the home page of a Web site. Campaigns that convert will make sure that users land on a page that is relevant to their search. The aim is to keep the user as focused on the goal—conversion—as possible. Sending the user to the home page gives him too many other options to choose from.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p03">For example, if someone searched for “Canon EOS 450D,” a poorly run campaign would send that user to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.canon.co.uk">http://www.canon.co.uk</a>. A better campaign would have the user clicking through to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_450D/index.asp">http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_450D/index.asp</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p04">Landing pages also indicate relevance to the search engine, which can increase the Quality Score of the advertisement, and in turn lower the CPC (cost per click) of the keyword. Adding pages to the Web site that are keyword rich can also carry SEO (search engine optimization) benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p05">PPC campaigns often have thousands of keywords, which can mean that there will be a lot of landing pages to be built! Creating <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dynamic landing pages</a><span class="glossdef">Unique, keyword-rich landing pages that can be created for each search using a simple script.</span></span> means that with a simple script, unique keyword-rich landing pages can be created for every search. The script will take the keyword that the searcher has used, and insert it in predefined places on the landing page. The user will then be landing on a page that is highly relevant to their search!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p06">Dynamic landing pages can be created with a simple script that will allow for a landing page to be created for every keyword in the PPC campaign.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p07">The bounce rate of the landing page also affects the Quality Score of an advertisement. See <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch14#fwk-105454-ch14">Chapter 15 "Web Analytics and Conversion Optimization"</a> for more information.</p>

                <li>There are some clear steps one should take before launching a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign. It is important to take each one seriously for best results.</li>
                <li>Landing pages can make or break an advertising campaign. Sending a user to a home page is not wise. Instead, the page needs to be relevant for the user to get the most out of their search.</li>
