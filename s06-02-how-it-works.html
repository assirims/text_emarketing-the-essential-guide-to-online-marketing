        <h2 class="title editable block">Building Brand Awareness</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s02_p01">Making people aware of a brand or product is an important long-term goal for any marketer. Once customers know about the brand, the marketer has taken the first step toward gaining the customer’s trust and patronage. The better known a brand is, the more business they can do. And the ultimate goal is to do more business and sell more of the product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Online, creative advertising or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">banner</a><span class="glossdef">An online advertisement in the form of a graphic image that appears on a Web page.</span></span> advertising is largely visual, making it an ideal channel for promoting brand collateral.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Consumer Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Consumers can’t want what they don’t know about. Advertising needs to convince consumers about what they should want and why they should want it. Modern online advertising provides a great way to communicate the USPs (unique selling points) of a product, thereby helping stimulate demand.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Satisfying Consumer Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s04_p01">Once the consumer is aware of and desires a product, they need to find out how to satisfy that desire. If brand building has been effective, they will know that a particular brand exists. At this point, it is important for the marketer to show the consumer how their particular brand or product will best meet that need.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s05_p01">All forms of online marketing need to drive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">traffic</a><span class="glossdef">This refers to the visitors that visit a Web site.</span></span> and sales in the long term. However, the immediacy of online advertising also drives traffic and sales in the short and medium terms. Unlike traditional media advertising, online advertising can turn the potential customer into an actual customer right there and then. What’s more, it is possible to measure accurately how effectively the online advertising campaign does this.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s06_p01">Online advertising is able to drive instant sales and conversions.

Because of the connected nature of the Internet, online activities are highly trackable and measurable, which makes it possible to target advertisements and to accurately track and gauge the effectiveness of the advertising. Each display advertisement can be tracked for success.</p>
