CPC advertising is normally associated with paid search marketing, also called pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. Banners can be priced this way when the aim is to drive traffic. It is also a payment method sometimes used in affiliate marketing, when the aim is to drive traffic to a new Web site.</p>

Definitions of acquisitions vary from site to site and may be a user filling in a form, downloading a file, or buying a product. CPA is the best way for an advertiser to pay because they only pay when the advertising has met its goal. For this reason it is also the worst type for the publisher as they are only rewarded if the advertising is successful. The publisher has to rely on the conversion rate of the advertiser’s Web site, something that the publisher cannot control. The CPA model is not commonly used for banner advertising and is generally associated with affiliate marketing.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s04_s02_s06_p01">Cost per engagement is an emerging technology in which advertisers pay for the rollover advertisements, placed in videos or applications (such as Facebook applications), based on the interactions with that advertisement. “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Engagement</a><span class="glossdef">Implies a level of interaction and intent from the user.</span></span>” is generally defined as a user-initiated rollover, or mouseover, action that results in a sustained advertisement expansion. Once expanded, an advertisement may contain a video, game, or other rich content. It happens without taking an Internet user away from her preferred Web page, and marketers only pay when an individual completes an action.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s04_s02_s06_p03">CPM favors the publisher, while CPA favors the advertiser. Sometimes, a hybrid of the two payment models is pursued.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s04_s02_s06_p04">Typically, high-traffic, broad-audience Web sites will offer CPM advertising.

Niche Web sites with a targeted audience are more likely to offer CPA advertising to advertisers with an appropriate product. These can also fall under the umbrella of affiliate marketing.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s04_s02_s06_p06">Types of advertising can be seen on a scale from more intrusive (and thus potentially annoying to the consumer) to less intrusive. In the same way, payment models can be scaled to those that favor the publisher to those that favor the advertiser. When planning a campaign, it is important to know how the advertising will be paid for and what kinds of advertising are offered by publishers. A lot of this can be solved by using a company that specializes in advertisement serving, media planning, and media buying.</p>
