    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p01">Search engines need to help users find what they’re looking for. To make sure they list the best results first, they look for signals of the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_l02">
        <li>Relevance</li>
        <li>Importance</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p02">Search engine optimization (SEO), also called organic or natural optimization, involves optimizing Web sites to achieve high rankings on the search engines for certain selected key phrases.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p03">This is achieved by making changes to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypertext markup language (HTML)</a><span class="glossdef">The “language” read by Web browsers. Certain HTML “tags” are used to structure the information and features within a Web page. As an example, HTML e-mails usually contain graphics and can be interactive.</span></span> code, content, and structure of a Web site, making it more accessible for search engines, and by extension, easier to find by users. These are also known as on-page factors. SEO also involves off-page factors—these generally build <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">links</a><span class="glossdef">A link is a URL (uniform resource locator) imbedded on a Web page. If you click on the link you will be taken to that page.</span></span> to the Web site. Activities to increase links to a Web site, including social media and Web public relations (WebPR), are considered off-page SEO.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p04">SEO is an extremely effective way of generating new business to a site. It is a continuous process and a way of thinking about how search engines see your Web site and how users use search engines to find your Web site. It’s search psychology.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p05">SEO is a fairly technical practice, but it can easily be broken down into five main areas:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_l03">
        <li>A search engine–friendly Web site structure</li>
        <li>A well-researched list of key phrases</li>
        <li>Content optimized to target those key phrases</li>
        <li>Link popularity</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_s02_p03">Rand Fishkin of SEOmoz says, “The key to ensuring that a site’s contents are fully crawlable is to provide direct, HTML links to each page you want the search engine spiders to index. Remember that if a page cannot be accessed from the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">home page</a><span class="glossdef">The first page of any Web site. The home page gives users a glimpse into what your site is about—very much like the index in a book or the contents of a magazine.</span></span> (where most spiders are likely to start their crawl) it is likely that it will not be indexed by the search engines.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn06_003">Rand Fishkin, <em class="emphasis">The Beginner’s Guide to SEO</em>, SEOmoz, February 25, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.seomoz.org/article/beginners-guide-to-search-engine-optimization">http://www.seomoz.org/article/beginners-guide-to-search-engine-optimization</a> (accessed April 3, 2008).</span></p>
