<span class="title-prefix">15.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_p01">Picture the scene: you’ve opened up a new fashion retail outlet in the trendiest shopping center in town. You’ve spent a small fortune on advertising and branding. You’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that you’re stocking all the prestige brands. Come opening day, your store is inundated with visitors and potential customers. And yet, you are hardly making any sales. Could it be because you have one cashier for every hundred customers? Or maybe it’s the fact that the smell of your freshly painted walls is chasing customers away before they complete a purchase. While it can be difficult to isolate and track the factors affecting your revenue in this fictional store, move it online and you have a wealth of resources available to assist you with tracking, analyzing, and optimizing your performance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_p02">To a marketer, the Internet offers more than new avenues of creativity. By its very nature, the Internet allows you to track each click to your site and through your site. It takes the guesswork out of pinpointing the successful elements of a campaign and can show you very quickly what’s not working. It all comes down to knowing where to look, knowing what to look for, and knowing what to do with the information you find.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_s02_p01">Testing, analyzing, and optimizing are not new to marketing. Being able to gauge the success of any campaign is crucial to growth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_s02_p02">Early Web analytics packages came to the fore in the mid-1990s, a couple of years after the first Mosaic browser was launched. Early analysis reflected the nature of the early Web, focusing only on hits with some very basic click-stream analysis. With one-page Web sites being the norm, it was enough to know how many clicks came to the Web site. Traffic meant you were doing well. You can still see hit counters on some Web sites today. These Web sites usually look as sophisticated as this tool.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s01_s02_p03">However, as Web sites became more complex, and as more people had access to the Internet, better analysis became more important. Measuring hits was, and is, not enough. In fact, measuring hits is a fairly meaningless task. Web analytics split into two types of tools: page tags and log files. Both continue to become more sophisticated, capturing information about visitors to a Web site, and recording detailed information related to their time on the site. There are several log-file analysis tools that cost nothing to use. Sophisticated page-tag Web analytics became available for free when Google bought Urchin in March 2005 and launched Google Analytics as a free service. Are you wondering what the difference is between page tagging and log-file analysis? Don’t worry, it’s coming!</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_p01">When it comes to Web analytics and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversion</a><span class="glossdef">A visitor completing a target action.</span></span> optimization, it is all about preparation. It is not just about collecting data; you need to know what data you are going to use. Once data have been collected, you need to analyze them and let the numbers inform your optimization tasks.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Goals, Events, and Key Performance Indicators</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p01">The key to the success of any Web site or online campaign is that it is designed with clearly defined <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">goals</a><span class="glossdef">The defined action that visitors should perform on a Web site or the purpose of the Web site.</span></span> in mind. These will be used to measure the success of the Web site or campaign and are crucial to maintaining focus within online activities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p02">The goal of a Web site or campaign may depend on the type of industry, but usually it will be an action that results in revenue for the company. The goal of a Web site is also intrinsically linked to the action that you want <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">visitors</a><span class="glossdef">An individual visiting a Web site that is not a search engine spider or a script.</span></span> to perform.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p03">Although a Web site has an ultimate goal, the process of achieving that goal can be broken down into several steps. These are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">events</a><span class="glossdef">A step a visitor takes in the conversion process.</span></span> or microconversions. Analyzing each step in the process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">funnel</a><span class="glossdef">A defined path that visitors should take to reach the final objective.</span></span> analysis or path analysis and is critical to understanding where problems in the conversion process may lie. The clicks visitors make once landed on a site, whether they follow the desired steps or not, are referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click path</a><span class="glossdef">The clicks taken by a visitor to a Web site in one visit.</span></span>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p04">For example, on a hotel Web site, the ultimate goal is that visitors to the site make a booking on the Web site with a credit card.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p05">Each step in the process is an event that can be analyzed as a conversion point:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Event 1</strong>. Perform a search for available dates for hotels in the desired area.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Event 2</strong>. Check prices and amenities for available hotels.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Event 3</strong>. Select a hotel and go to checkout.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Event 4</strong>. Enter personal and payment details and confirm booking (conversion).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p06">One expects fewer users at each step; that’s why it’s called a funnel. Increasing the number of visitors who progress from one step to the next will go a long way to improving the overall conversion rate of the site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p07">There are also other pointers, or indicators, that you are achieving your goals. These are factors that can be optimized to ensure that your ultimate goal is being met. In Web analytics, these are referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as key success indicators (KSIs), these help an organization define and measure progress toward organizational goals.</span></span>. These need to be defined so you monitor the entire process to achieving your Web site goal. They can also give clues as to what factors you need to work on so as to reach your goal.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p08">Events and KPIs are not the same thing. Events can be seen as steps toward a goal and are usually an action performed by a visitor. KPIs are indicators that the Web site’s goals are being met.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p09">Here are some example goals and KPIs for different Web sites:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p10">For a hospitality e-commerce site, such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.expedia.com">http://www.expedia.com</a>, one would expect the following goals:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>Increase bookings</li>
            <li>Decrease marketing expenses</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p11">For the same site, one would expect the following KPIs:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_l03">
            <li>Conversion rate</li>
            <li>Cost per visitor</li>
            <li>Average order value</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p12">For news and content sites, such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.news24.com">http://www.news24.com</a>, one would expect the following goals:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_l04">
            <li>Increase readership and level of interest</li>
            <li>Increase time visitors spend on Web site</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p13">For the same site, one would expect the following KPIs:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_l05">
            <li>Length of visit</li>
            <li>Average time spent on Web site</li>
            <li>Percentage of returning visitors</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p14">KPIs help you to look at the factors that you can influence. For example, if your goal is to increase revenue, you could look at ways of increasing your conversion rate (that is the number of visitors who purchase something). One way of increasing conversion rate could be to offer a discount. So you would have more sales but probably a lower average order value. Or you could look at ways of increasing the average order value, so the conversion rate would stay the same, but you increase the revenue from each conversion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p15">Once you have established your goals, events, and KPIs, you need to be able to track the data that will help you analyze how you are performing and how you can optimize your Web site or campaign.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s02_s02_p16">KPIs and events break down the factors and steps that can be influences so as to achieve the goals of the Web site. They allow you to see on a micro level what is affecting performance on a macro level.</p>

    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_l01">
            <li>Understand why tracking and data collection are important to eMarketing.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p01">Currently, there are two main technology approaches for collecting Web analytics data: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">log-file analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Analysis of log records, which shows where visitors are coming from, how often they visit, and their path through the site. When used in conjunction with cookies, this analysis provides much more in-depth information.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">page tagging</a><span class="glossdef">The process of tagging Web pages with embedded JavaScript files.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p02">Log-file analysis software reads the records, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">log files</a><span class="glossdef">Text files created on the server each time a click takes place, capturing all activity on the Web site.</span></span>, on the Web server, which record all clicks that take place on the server. Web servers have always stored all the clicks that take place in a log file, so the software interprets data that have always been available. A new line is written in a log file with each new request. For example, clicking on a link, an Ajax call, or submitting a form will each result in a new line being written.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p03">Page tagging, on the other hand, sends information to a third-party server, where statistics can be generated. The browser executes JavaScript code that communicates with the tracking software, creating <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">page tags</a><span class="glossdef">JavaScript files embedded on a Web page and executed by the browser.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p04">Pixel tracking can be used to track e-mail campaigns. Here, a tiny, transparent pixel is placed in the e-mail. When you load the images in the e-mail, you will also load the tiny image that tracks your activity.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p05">Caching is when a browser stores some of the information for a Web page so it can retrieve the page more quickly when you return to it. If a Web page is cached by your browser, when you look at the page again, it will not send a request to the Web server. This means that that particular visit will not show in the log files. Page tagging, however, would capture this visit. But some browsers do not support JavaScript, and page tagging would not capture those visits. This is why there is often a discrepancy in the numbers reported by the two services.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Log-File Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02_p01">In terms of log-file analysis, you should know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Log files are normally produced by Web servers, so the raw data are readily available. Page tagging, however, requires changes to the Web site.</li>
            <li>Log files are very accurate—they record every click. Page tagging can be less accurate. If a user’s browser does not support JavaScript, for example, no information will be captured.</li>
            <li>Log files are in a standard format, so it is possible to switch vendors and still be able to analyze historical data. Page tagging is proprietary to each vendor, so switching can mean losing historical data.</li>
            <li>Log files record visits from search engine spiders—useful for search engine optimization.</li>
            <li>Log files record failed requests, whereas page tagging only shows successful requests.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Page Tagging</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p01">In terms of page tagging, you should know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>JavaScript makes it easier to capture more information (e.g., products purchased or screen size of a user’s browser). You can use log-file analysis to capture this information, but it will involve modifying the URLs (uniform resource locators).</li>
            <li>Page tagging can report on events, such as interactions with a Flash movie, that log-file analysis cannot.</li>
            <li>Page tagging can be used by companies that do not run their own Web servers.</li>
            <li>Page tagging service providers usually offer a greater level of support. This is because it is a third-party service, whereas log-file analysis software is often managed in-house.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Because of the different methods of collecting data, the raw figures produced by the two services will differ. Sometimes, both are used to analyze a Web site. However, raw figures not matching up should not be a problem. It is through interpreting these figures that you will be able to understand how effective your eMarketing efforts are.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p03">Web site analytics packages can be used to measure most, if not all, eMarketing campaigns. Web site analysis should always account for the various campaigns being run. For example, generating high traffic volumes by employing various eMarketing tactics like SEO (search engine optimization), PPC (pay per click), and e-mail marketing can prove to be a pointless and costly exercise if the visitors are leaving your site without achieving one (or more) of your Web site’s goals. Conversion optimization aims to convert as many of a Web site’s visitors as possible into active customers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_p03">These are the most basic Web metrics. They tell you how much traffic your Web site is receiving. Looking at repeat and returning visitors can tell you about how your Web site creates loyalty. As well as growing overall visitor numbers, a Web site needs to grow the number of visitors who come back. An exception might be a support Web site—repeat visitors could indicate that the Web site has not been successful in solving the visitor’s problem. Each Web site needs to be analyzed based on its purpose.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p03">A crucial, and often overlooked, part of this analysis is that of internal search. Internal search refers to the searches that users perform on the Web site of the Web site’s content. While a great deal of time is spent analyzing and optimizing external search—using search engines to reach the Web site in question—analyzing internal search goes a long way toward determining how effective a Web site is in delivering solutions to visitors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p04">Internal and external search data are likely to be very different and can go a long way to exposing weaknesses in site navigation and the internal search itself and can expose gaps in inventory on which a Web site can capitalize.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p05">For example, consider the keywords a user might use when searching for a hotel Web site and keywords that might be used by a the user when on the Web site.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p06">Keywords to search for a hotel Web site might be the following:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p07">Once on the Web site, the user might use the site search function to find out further information. Keywords he or she might use include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_l02">
                <li>Table Mountain</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p02">In these cases, only one variable is tested at a time, and all other elements on the Web page, in the e-mail, or part of the PPC advertisement remain the same. You can test more than one version of the variable; it just means that you will need to test for longer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p03">Traffic is then randomly distributed to the different versions, and the outcomes are measured for each version of the variable. The results are then interpreted to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the variables. The version producing the best results can then be employed.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p04">Remember studying statistics? It’s going to come in handy here. You don’t need to send huge amounts of traffic to a different version of a Web page to determine success. In fact, it can be risky to do so.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_p01">Multivariate testing allows you to test many variables at once and still determine which version of each variable has a statistically significant effect on your outcomes. For Web sites, there are a number of vendors who will host pages that are being tested in this way remotely, if you do not have the technology to do this in-house.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_p02">Multivariate testing allows you to test, for example, the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_l01">

This can show you what visual clues on your Web page influence where your visitors click, and this can be used to optimize the click path of your visitors.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p03">There are many factors that could be preventing your visitors from achieving specific end goals. From the tone of the copy to the color of the page, everything on your Web site may affect conversions. Possible factors are often so glaringly obvious that one tends to miss them or so small that they are dismissed as trivial. Changing one factor may result in other unforeseen consequences, and it is vital to ensure that we don’t jump to the wrong conclusions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p04">There are many techniques that can be used to improve conversion rates, depending on which area is being improved. A better landing page, for example, can reduce the drop-off between a PPC and adding a product to the shopping cart. And reducing that drop-off can go a long way to improving the cost per acquisition (CPA). <a class="xref" href="#fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_f02">Figure 15.5</a> shows how small changes in conversion rate can make a big difference to the CPA.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p05">One of the most important aspects of conversion optimization is keeping visitors focused on their goals. To do this, it is important to maintain a highly visible and influential click path from the landing page to the goal or action page that is as short as possible. The more links and irrelevant distractions that are present on a site, the less likely visitors are to remain focused on achieving your desired objectives.</p>

Don’t take people to your home page by default if they’re looking for specific keywords and are clicking through on designated links or (more importantly) are coming through a PPC campaign. Again, keep them focused on the defined goal; rather, let them enter where they are most comfortable thereby keeping the path to conversion as short as possible.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s04_p02">However, it can be easy to become fixated on figures instead of using them to optimize campaign growth. Generally, macro, or global, metrics should be looked at before starting to analyze micro elements of a Web site. Testing variables is vital to success. Results always need to be statistically analyzed, and marketers should let these numbers make the decisions. Never assume the outcome—wait for the numbers to inform you.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p01">Web sites with high volumes of traffic have the opportunity to test regularly and make sure that they are optimizing conversions. Online retailers such as Amazon.com make frequent small changes, hardly noticed by their visitors, to ensure that they are converting as many visitors into buyers as possible. Likewise, the high volume of traffic to Google’s home page allows it to test new features with a small percentage of visitors before rolling them out to all users.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p02">Firefox is a free, open-source browser that is currently used by about 47 percent of the market, and it is gaining market share. When launching version 3 of the browser, Firefox 3, Firefox developer Mozilla (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mozilla.org">http://www.mozilla.org</a>) aimed to enter the Guinness Book of Records for most software downloads in twenty-four hours starting June 17, 2008. The aim was 5 million downloads. Firefox 2.0 registered 1.6 million downloads on the first day it was made available on October 24, 2006.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p03">Mozilla wanted visitors to the Web site to perform one action: download Firefox. With a publicized record attempt, it was necessary to make the process as smooth as possible. The landing page for Firefox 2 was already successful. FutureNow conversion analyst Josh Hay noted that “their Call to Action does so many things right. The non-standard shape stands out from the background of the page, and has been given a persuasive color that draws the eyes to it. They’ve even used it to reinforce their brand. Within the Call to Action, Firefox lists the benefit and tells the visitor exactly what he is getting.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn14_003">Josh Hay, “Large Red Buttons?

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p05">With the new download page, the download button is in the same basic design, but with a few nuanced changes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p06">First, the name and version of the browser has changed position on the page. It has moved from a large on-page heading and onto the actual download button. The text on the button has also changed, from “Download Firefox—Free” to “Free Download.” There is also a little image on the Firefox 3 download button that was not used on the Firefox 2 landing page—an arrow to indicate the download action. The information about the version of the browser has also been split over two lines in the Firefox 3 download button.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p07">The download button and the placement of the Firefox logo (the fox around the globe) have had a subtle revision. The logo is now clearly integrated into the download button. On the Firefox 3 page, the hyperlinks are not underlined, emphasizing the single purpose of the download button.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s05_p08">Did it work? Mozilla records that there were over 8 million downloads of Firefox 3 in its first twenty-four hours of release—over 5,500 downloads a minute! Mozilla’s commitment to optimizing the all-important Firefox 3 landing page paid off.</p>
