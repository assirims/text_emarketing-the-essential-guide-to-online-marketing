        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p02">In terms of the company, one can track the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Brand name</li>

            <li>Key products</li>
            <li>Key personnel (names, job titles, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p03">In terms of the industry, one can track the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>Conferences</li>
            <li>Patents</li>
            <li>News</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p04">In terms of competitors, one can track the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l03">
            <li>Brand names</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p05">For example, if Apple were to use these tools to monitor its reputation, some keywords used for the company might be the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l04">
            <li>Apple</li>

            <li>Macbook, iPod, Macbook Air, iTunes</li>
            <li>“Steve Jobs”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p06">For its industry, Apple might use the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l05">
            <li>Consumer Electronics Show Las Vegas</li>
            <li>CeBIT</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p07">For its competitors, Apple might use the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l06">
            <li>Microsoft, Creative</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p08">It is also important to track common misspellings, all related companies, and all related Web sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p09">Tracking the names of people key to a company can highlight potential brand attacks or can demonstrate new areas of outreach for a company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p10">Brand names, employee names, product names, and even competitor names are not unique. To avoid monitoring too much, identify keywords that will indicate that a post has nothing to do with your company and negative match that keyword in your searches.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p11">For example, “apple” could refer to a consumer electronics company, or it could appear in a post about the health benefits of fruit. Finding keywords that will indicate context can help save time. So you could negative match words like “fruit,” “tasty,” and “Granny Smith.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Thankfully, ORM does not entail hourly searches on your favorite search engine to see what is appearing on the search engine results page (SERPs), although being aware of your search space is vital as well. There are a number of search engines that allow users to narrow a search to particular media or industries, and using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">RSS</a><span class="glossdef">Abbreviates all the content most Web sites on the World Wide Web contain in order to provide you with specific content you want.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Monitoring all mentions means that the following need to be tracked:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s03_p05">Google has several search services, some of which have been mentioned previously, and periodically adds more to the list.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s03_p09">There might be Web sites that a company would like to monitor for keyword mentions that do not offer RSS feeds.

                <li>With ORM, there is no need for costly focus groups to know a brand’s reputation.</li>
                <li>Conversations are taking place all the time on the Internet, and it is crucial for companies to be aware of what is being said about them. Customers are now dictating the channels of communication, and companies that cannot engage with their consumers in this way stand to lose them.</li>
                <li>ORM is about using the tools of the Internet, the same tools that customers are using, to monitor, analyze, and ultimately influence the conversation. Companies need to learn to listen and engage.</li>
                <li>There are many free and paid-for tools available for monitoring online conversations, and with most it is easy to set up custom RSS feeds that will update with any new mentions. Mentions need to be analyzed for sentiment, credibility, influence, and source, and appropriate action to be taken.</li>
