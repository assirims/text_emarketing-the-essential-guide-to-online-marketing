            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p03">A crucial, and often overlooked, part of this analysis is that of internal search. Internal search refers to the searches that users perform on the Web site of the Web site’s content. While a great deal of time is spent analyzing and optimizing external search—using search engines to reach the Web site in question—analyzing internal search goes a long way toward determining how effective a Web site is in delivering solutions to visitors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p04">Internal and external search data are likely to be very different and can go a long way to exposing weaknesses in site navigation and the internal search itself and can expose gaps in inventory on which a Web site can capitalize.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p05">For example, consider the keywords a user might use when searching for a hotel Web site and keywords that might be used by a the user when on the Web site.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p06">Keywords to search for a hotel Web site might be the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Cape Town hotel</li>
                <li>Bed and breakfast Cape Town</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p07">Once on the Web site, the user might use the site search function to find out further information. Keywords he or she might use include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_l02">
                <li>Table Mountain</li>
                <li>Pets</li>
                <li>Babysitting service</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s02_p08">Analytics tools can show what keywords users search for, what pages they visit after searching, and, of course, whether they search again with a variation of or different keywords.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p01">At the end of the day, you want people who visit your Web site to perform an action that increases the Web site’s revenue. Analysis of goals and KPIs (key performance indicators) indicate where there is room for improvement. Look at user intent to establish how your Web site meets the user’s goals and if they match with the Web site goals. Look at user experience to determine how outcomes can be influenced.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s03_p03">After performing a search, one hundred visitors land on the home page of a Web site.

Ten visitors convert into paying customers. This event has a 50 percent conversion rate. The conversion rate of all visitors who performed the search is 10 percent, but by breaking this up into events we can analyze and improve the conversion rate of each event.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_p01">Determining the factors that affect user experience involves testing to determine why users do what they do.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_p02">Testing can be performed in a number of ways:</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">A/B Split Testing</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p01">A/B split testing measures one variable at a time to determine its effect on an outcome. Different versions are created for the variable you want to test. For example, consider the following tests:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_l01">
                    <li>Two e-mail subject lines for the same e-mail to see which produces a superior open rate</li>
                    <li>Different placements of the “buy now” on a product page to see which results in increased sales</li>
                    <li>Different copy styles on PPC (pay-per-click) advertisements to see which gives a higher CTR (click-through rate)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p02">In these cases, only one variable is tested at a time, and all other elements on the Web page, in the e-mail, or part of the PPC advertisement remain the same. You can test more than one version of the variable; it just means that you will need to test for longer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p03">Traffic is then randomly distributed to the different versions, and the outcomes are measured for each version of the variable. The results are then interpreted to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the variables. The version producing the best results can then be employed.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s02_p04">Remember studying statistics? It’s going to come in handy here. You don’t need to send huge amounts of traffic to a different version of a Web page to determine success. In fact, it can be risky to do so.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_p01">Multivariate testing allows you to test many variables at once and still determine which version of each variable has a statistically significant effect on your outcomes. For Web sites, there are a number of vendors who will host pages that are being tested in this way remotely, if you do not have the technology to do this in-house.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_p02">Multivariate testing allows you to test, for example, the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_l01">
                    <li>Subject lines and copy style for e-mails</li>
                    <li>Color, font size, and image size for Web sites</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s03_p03">The combinations are endless, and because of that, it is easy to get stuck analyzing every tiny detail. Successful testing relies on having clear objectives to begin with, and sufficient traffic to warrant such detail.</p>

Professional listening labs can be hired, or as Steve Krug points out in his book <em class="emphasis">Don’t Make Me Think!</em> they can be set up fairly easily in a quiet part of an office.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn14_002">Steve Krug, <em class="emphasis">Don’t Make Me Think!

This can show you what visual clues on your Web page influence where your visitors click, and this can be used to optimize the click path of your visitors.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p03">There are many factors that could be preventing your visitors from achieving specific end goals. From the tone of the copy to the color of the page, everything on your Web site may affect conversions. Possible factors are often so glaringly obvious that one tends to miss them or so small that they are dismissed as trivial. Changing one factor may result in other unforeseen consequences, and it is vital to ensure that we don’t jump to the wrong conclusions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p04">There are many techniques that can be used to improve conversion rates, depending on which area is being improved. A better landing page, for example, can reduce the drop-off between a PPC and adding a product to the shopping cart. And reducing that drop-off can go a long way to improving the cost per acquisition (CPA). <a class="xref" href="#fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_f02">Figure 15.5</a> shows how small changes in conversion rate can make a big difference to the CPA.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s02_s04_s05_p05">One of the most important aspects of conversion optimization is keeping visitors focused on their goals. To do this, it is important to maintain a highly visible and influential click path from the landing page to the goal or action page that is as short as possible. The more links and irrelevant distractions that are present on a site, the less likely visitors are to remain focused on achieving your desired objectives.</p>

Don’t take people to your home page by default if they’re looking for specific keywords and are clicking through on designated links or (more importantly) are coming through a PPC campaign. Again, keep them focused on the defined goal; rather, let them enter where they are most comfortable thereby keeping the path to conversion as short as possible.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s03_p01">The very first thing you need when it comes to Web analytics is a Web analytics tool for gathering data. Some are free and some require a fee. You will need to determine which package best serves your needs. Bear in mind that it is possible to switch vendors with log-file analysis software without losing historical data, but it is not as easy to do so with page-tagging software.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s03_p02">The following are some leading providers:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s03_p03">When it comes to running split tests, if you don’t have the technical capacity to run these in-house, there are a number of third-party services that can host these for you. Google’s Web site Optimizer (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer">http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer</a>) can help you do just that.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s04_p01">Tracking, analyzing, and optimizing are vital to the success of any marketing efforts, and even more so with online marketing efforts. eMarketing allows for easy and fast tracking and the ability to optimize frequently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s04_s04_p02">However, it can be easy to become fixated on figures instead of using them to optimize campaign growth. Generally, macro, or global, metrics should be looked at before starting to analyze micro elements of a Web site. Testing variables is vital to success. Results always need to be statistically analyzed, and marketers should let these numbers make the decisions. Never assume the outcome—wait for the numbers to inform you.</p>
