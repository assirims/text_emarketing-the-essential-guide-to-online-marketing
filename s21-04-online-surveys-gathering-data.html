    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_p01">When developing surveys you can combine qualitative data with quantitative data—it just depends on how the questions are asked. Conducting <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online surveys</a><span class="glossdef">A quantitative research method conducted via the Internet that aims to collect information about a population.</span></span> allows for data to be captured immediately, and data analysis can be performed easily and quickly. By using e-mail or the Web for conducting surveys, geographical limitations for collecting data can be overcome cost effectively.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_p02">Developing technology also allows for sophisticated and user-friendly surveys to be compiled. For example, as opposed to indicating impressions on a sliding scale, respondents can indicate emotional response.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_p01">The success of a survey in gathering useful data is largely determined by the design of the survey, and particularly by the questions that are asked. A survey can comprise any number and types of questions, and these should be structured in such a way that more complicated questions only appear once users are comfortable with the survey.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_p02">Be careful when creating questions that you do not introduce <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bias</a><span class="glossdef">An influence on the research process that affects one’s ability to analyze the research results objectively.</span></span> by asking leading questions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p02">According to SurveyMonkey, the ways in which the surveys are administered play a role in response rates for surveys, and these can be relative:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p03">Response rates can be improved by offering respondents an incentive for completing the survey, such as a chance at winning a grand prize, a lower priced incentive for every respondent, or even the knowledge that they are improving a product or service that they care about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p04">There is a train of thought that paying incentives is not always a good thing. Among less affluent or educated respondents it may predispose them to feel that they need to give so-called good or correct answers that may bias your results. Alternatively you may attract respondents who are in it just for the reward. One approach could be to run the survey with no incentive with the option to offer one if responses are limited.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_p01">As with all things eMarketing, careful planning goes a long way to determining success. As market research can be an expensive project, it is important that planning helps to determine the cost versus the benefit of the research. Qualitative research and secondary research are critical steps in determining whether a larger-scale research project is called for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_p02">Bear in mind that many tasks that fall under the umbrella of research should be ongoing requirements of eMarketing activities, such as conversion testing and optimizing and online reputation management. Polls and small surveys can also be conducted regularly, and nonintrusively, among visitors to your Web site.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s02_p01">Secondary research can be used to give background and context to the business problem and the context in which the problem can be solved. It should also be used to determine alternative strategies for solving the problem, which can be evaluated through research. Qualitative research, particularly using established online research communities, can also help in determining what the business problems are that need to be solved. Ultimately, determine what are the actions you will be considering after the research is completed and what insights are required to make a decision on those actions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s04_p01">The Internet provides a multitude of channels for gathering data. Surveys can be conducted online or via e-mail. Online research panels and online research communities can all be used for gathering data. Web analytics can also be used to collect data, but this is a passive form of data collection. Determine what will provide you with the information you need to make decisions. Be sure to think about whether your research calls for qualitative or quantitative data as this determines the methodology as well.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Room for Error</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p01">With all research, there is a given amount of error that needs to be dealt with. Errors may result from the interviewers administering a questionnaire (and possibly leading the respondents) to the design and wording of the questionnaire itself, sample errors, and respondent errors. Using the Internet to administer surveys and questionnaires removes the bias that may arise from an interviewer. However, with no interviewer to explain questions, there is potential for greater respondent error. This is why survey design is so important and why it is crucial to test and run pilots of the survey before going live.</p>

There is the possibility of respondents becoming desensitized. There is even a growing trend of professional survey takers, especially where there is an incentive involved. The general industry standard is to limit respondents to being interviewed once every six months.</p>

Some people are just not interested in, nor will ever be interested in, taking part in surveys. Are these people fundamentally different, with different purchasing behavior, from those who do? Is there a way of finding out? To some extent, Web analytics, which tracks the behavior of all visitors to your Web site, can be useful in determining the answer to this question.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p04">When conducting any survey, it is crucial to understand who is in the target universe and what the best way to reach that target universe is. Web surveys exclude elements of the population, due to access or ability. It is vital to determine if this is acceptable to the survey and to use other means of capturing data if it is not.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Conducting Research: Who’s Going to Pay?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s05_p01">Regular research is an important aspect of the growth strategy of any business, but it can be tough to justify the budget necessary for research without knowing the benefit to the business. Conducting research can cost little more than the time of someone who works for a company, depending on the skills base of employees, or it can be an expensive exercise involving external experts. Deciding where your business needs are on the investment scale depends on the depth of the research required and what the expected growth will be for the business. When embarking on a research initiative, the cost to benefit ratio should be determined.</p>
