<span class="title-prefix">14.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p01">When it comes to writing copy on the Internet, content is king. The copy on a Web page is a hardworking multitasker. It needs to provide information to visitors, engage with them, and lead them to perform a desired action—all while conveying brand ethos. It also needs to provide context and relevance to search engines. And it needs to achieve all this fluidly without appearing to be trying too hard.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p02">Copywriting is a fundamental element of effective online marketing. Whether writing an e-mail to a colleague or PPC (pay-per-click) advertisements for a new product launch, learning how to write effective online copy will make you a better communicator.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p03">Online copywriting entails everything from the copy of Web site pages, to the content of an e-mail, and all written elements in between. From eight-hundred-word WebPR (Web public relations) articles to three-line PPC advertisements, if it’s being read on a screen, it’s online copy. Ultimately, you are writing on the Web to meet business objectives, so it is important to never sway from the strategic element and potential of your online copy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p04">Focus on writing in a strategic, persuasive, compelling manner.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_p01">When writing for the Web, it does not mean that traditional approaches to copywriting need to be ditched. The foundations remain—they just need to be adapted to an online environment. The first step you need to take is to research your target audience, understand their needs, and write copy that solves their problems and answers their questions while engaging with them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_p02">Understanding your audience will guide you in determining the topics that they want to read about and will help you to organize information in a way that makes sense to your audience. It will direct the tone of your copy as well as the content.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_p03">Sometimes it helps to write for just one person. Pick out someone you know who fits your audience, or make someone up, and write for that person. In copywriting, this person who fits your audience is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">persona</a><span class="glossdef">A character used to represent a group of visitors to a Web site.</span></span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_p04">The Internet has led to an audience of one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn13_001">Jonathan Price and Lisa Price, <em class="emphasis">Hot Text: Web Writing That Works</em> (Indianapolis: New Riders, 2002).</span> What does this mean? While your audience is not literally one person (and if it is, thank your mom for reading your Web site, but spend some time on growing your readership), it is not a vast, vaguely defined crowd. Instead, online we have many niche audiences who are used to being addressed as individuals. Online, many of the individuals in our audience also exchange information via blogs, forums, and other forms of social media.</p>

    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_l02">
        <li>Who is my audience?</li>
        <li>What actions do I want them to take?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Personas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p01">Personas are based on the profile of readers of your copy—the visitors to your Web site and potential customers. Creating a profile is all about considering the needs and desires of your Web site visitors and effectively meeting them. For example, How do they make purchase decisions? Do they compare lots of service providers before selecting one? Do they make lists of questions and call in for assistance with decision making? Or do they make purchase decisions spontaneously based on a special offer?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p02">Web site copy can be structured in such a way that it caters for several personas, but you need to spend time understanding their needs before you are able to write copy that addresses these needs with conviction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p03">Understanding the profiles of your readers is an important element, and the best copy usually results from extensive time spent figuring out who your audience is.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p04">When writing on behalf of clients, it is very important that you have clearly understood what their corporate “personality” is so that you can convey this in your copy without deviating from their corporate identity or diluting their brand ethos.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p05">Writing an online copy—guidelines document will enable you to fall back on the styles, conventions, and voice that you are required to write for. Understanding and sticking to this corporate voice is just as important as the audience you are tailoring your content for. The two need to work together and draw from one another for direction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s02_p06">By sticking to style conventions, you will assist the audience in familiarizing themselves with author personas. This way, they will know what bits of content go where in a document, and this allows for easier navigation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Copy That Is Easy to Read</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p01">Online copy is judged first and foremost on its layout, regardless of the content. It needs to appear to be well structured and easy to read before a visitor will choose to read it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p02">A good online copywriter will also be able to use basic HTML (hypertext markup language), knowing that it is the appealing layout of the page that will get their words read. It should be easy for users to skip and skim the copy, effortlessly finding the parts that are most relevant to them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p03">Online copy should be pleasant to read and easy to scan. This means making use of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>Bulleted and numbered lists</li>

            <li>Clear and concise headings</li>
            <li>Bold and italic text</li>
            <li>Descriptive links</li>
            <li>Calls to action (CTAs) above the fold</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p04">It’s easy to see this in practice.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p05">Readers online are usually strapped for time and need to decide quickly whether or not to read a page. This means that the most important information needs to be at the top of the page. Start with the summary or conclusion—the main idea or gist of the article.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s03_p06">While clever wordplay in headings and titles can attract some attention, online these need to be written as descriptively as possible. The copy is multitasking: not only is it informing visitors of what to expect, it is also telling search engine spiders what the page is about. Be creative, but keep it relevant.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Learning to Use HTML</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_p01">HTML stands for hypertext markup language, and it’s the foundation of documents on the Internet. HTML tags tell browsers how to present content. HTML tags are in the brackets that look like arrows: &lt; and &gt;.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_p02">When writing online copy, you can use an HTML editor, where you insert the tags yourself, or a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, which works in a similar way to a word processor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_p03">Basic HTML is simple to implement and will help you to lay out your content in an easy-to-read way. Here are some basic HTML tags:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bold</strong>. &lt;b&gt;phrase you wish to bold&lt;/b&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Italicize</strong>. &lt;i&gt;phrase you wish to italicize&lt;/i&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Underline</strong>. &lt;u&gt;phrase you wish to underline&lt;/u&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">List</strong>. &lt;li&gt;lines you wish to list&lt;/li&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create a paragraph</strong>. &lt;p&gt;paragraph text&lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Insert a line break</strong>. &lt;br/&gt;</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Insert a link</strong>. &lt;a href=“page url”&gt;phrase you wish to link&lt;/a&gt;</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_p04">The tags also help search engines to identify how the content has been laid out on the page.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s02_s04_p05">The best way to get to grips with HTML is to start using it online where you can see how the tags work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p01">A crucial element to online copywriting is the CTA. Users scan Web pages and look for clues as to what to do. Don’t make them think; tell them what action to perform.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p02">A call to action is a short, descriptive instruction that explicitly tells a Web visitor what to do. Banner advertising usually involves a clear call to action, and it can also be used in paid search advertising. Call-to-action copy is not limited to short copy: e-mail newsletters and promotions should also make use of call to action, and we even see them all over Web pages. Calls to action should always be above the fold to drive action.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p05">A strong call to action resonates with the action that the visitor needs to take, as opposed to the technical function that is performed. For example, if a user has entered an e-mail address to sign up to your e-mail newsletter, the action button should say “sign up” (which is what a user understands) and not “submit” (which is the database action).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p06">Consider what actions mean offline:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_l03">
            <li>With e-mail newsletters, “sign up” can have very different connotations from “subscribe.”</li>
            <li>“Subscribe” is very different from “subscribe for free.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p07">Whereas subscriptions connote regularity as to the times when newsletters are sent (e.g., once a week, on a particular day at a particular time), “sign up” does not carry the same burden. There is only one way to know what call to action works best on a Web page, in an e-mail, on a banner, or in an advertisement: test, test, test. You could do this by performing A/B split tests to see which CTA drives the most clicks or actions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p01">Writing compelling copy means conveying to readers why they should perform an action. While <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">features</a><span class="glossdef">A prominent aspect of a product that is beneficial to users.</span></span> may seem all-important, you need to communicate the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">benefits</a><span class="glossdef">The positive outcome for a user that a feature provides.</span></span> of the features to the user, as this is the ultimate driver of action.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p02">Features and benefits are very different. Features are what are important to the company that provides the product or service. Benefits are what are important to those who decide to use the product or service.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p13">Dynamic keyword insertion allows for the search term used to be inserted into the advertisement copy. This means that you can write one advertisement, and every time it appears for a different search term, that search term will be inserted into the advertisement. In the copy for the advertisement, it looks like this:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p14">{keyword:alternative word}</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p15">The brackets indicate that this is where the dynamic keyword should go. The copywriter also needs to select an alternative keyword to show if the search term used does not fit into the space available.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_p02">Longer online copy allows you to foster a relationship with a reader, whether it is on a blog, through e-mail communications, or through articles and news releases.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Titles and subject lines are there for a very important reason: they inform readers whether or not they are likely to want to read further by giving a sneak preview into what is to come in the article. They are the gateway to your content.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p02">Consider the following two titles:</p>

            <li>Guide to Online Copywriting</li>
            <li>Ten Steps to Writing Online Copy That Sells</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p03">The second title conveys more information to the reader that helps the reader decide to read further. Minor word manipulation that tells the reader how he or she will benefit from reading that content can make a huge difference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p04">Subject lines are like titles for e-mails and can make the difference between an e-mail being deleted instantly and being opened and read. Subject lines also work hand in hand with the “from” field of an e-mail. Both fields usually appear side by side in an in-box and are used to determine relevance, familiarity, and trust.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p05">Use a consistent and easy-to-recognize <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sender alias</a><span class="glossdef">The name that is chosen to appear in the sender or “from” field of an e-mail.</span></span>—the “from” field—so that readers can recognize your e-mails easily. With familiarity and trust established using this field, the subject line can be used more creatively, allowing you to build on the already-established relationships with your readers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p06">As with a title, use the subject line to make clear what the e-mail is about. For example, if there is a promotion in the e-mail, consider putting it in the subject line as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s02_p07">Titles, headlines, and subject lines need to be both persuasive and enticing. Consider what need your copy is meeting for your readers and express that first. Be honest and straightforward and never misrepresent the content of an e-mail as this will prevent readers from opening them in the future.</p>

In addition to assisting you with structuring your content, these tags indicate relevancy and context to search engines.

The meta description can also be used by search engines on the search engine results pages (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SERPs</a><span class="glossdef">What you see when you perform a search on a search engine.</span></span>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p02">A keyword refers to the word or words that are used in a search query on a search engine. Multiword keywords are sometimes referred to as key phrases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p03">The first step in SEO copywriting is <strong class="emphasis bold">keyword research</strong>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_p04">Each page should be optimized for a primary key phrase and can be optimized for a secondary and tertiary key phrase as well. Usually a Web page is optimized for three key phrases but can be optimized for up to five (though only if the page is very long). Any more than that and you are better off creating new, niche Web pages.</p>

Take time to consider how to make this relevant as well as convincing enough to get a searcher to click on your page instead of your competitor’s.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p01">Spiders assign more relevance to the text used in headings, so it is important to use your key phrases in the headings on your page. It also helps to structure your content.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p02">Heading structures include the following:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p03">&lt;h1&gt;Page heading. What the page content is about&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p04">&lt;h2&gt;Subheadings. “Chapters” of content breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p05">&lt;h3&gt;Information under the subheadings. Elaboration of main headings and more detail&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s06_p06">Having a good heading hierarchy is important as spiders use it to move through your page. The hierarchy indicates what is more important and how the content is broken up. It also makes it easier for the reader to take in your content if it is arranged in a way that makes sense to her.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p01">The number of times you use the key phrases is entirely dependent on how long the page of copy is. You want to optimize the page for the key phrases without their use being overt.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p02">For SEO effectiveness, a page of Web copy should not be less than 250 words. On a 250-word page you could use the primary key phrase eight times (this includes use in metadata, headings, title, and body copy) and the secondary key phrase four times.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s07_p04">The average Web page should not be so long that the user needs to scroll and scroll to get to the end of it. If you find the page is getting exceptionally long, consider breaking it into different sections. This way you could add more pages of optimized copy focused on one theme, instead of one very long page. This also allows for you to optimize pages for more keywords, targeting various search queries.</p>

The anchor text of links should include the key phrase of the page being linked to and not the page being linked from.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s09_p01">Alt text refers to the “alt” attribute for the IMG HTML (image HTML element) tag: this is the text that appears in the caption. It is used in HTML to attribute a text field to an image on a Web page, normally with a descriptive function, telling a user what an image is about and displaying the text in instances where the image is unable to load. While this is handy for readers, we also do it for another reason: search engine spiders can’t read images, but they can read the alt text. The image title tag is what shows when you hover with your mouse over an image and can also be read by the search engine spider. It also appears on a page where images may have been blocked or take time to load.</p>

Dictionaries and reference guides celebrate this regularly with a “word of the year,” usually one that has been in heavy use by the Internet audience for the three years preceding its entrance into a dictionary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s03_s10_p03">For example, in 2009, “unfriend” was voted the word of the year by the editors of the <em class="emphasis">New Oxford American Dictionary</em>, while “w00t” had its day in 2007 when it was featured on <em class="emphasis">Merriam-Webster</em>’s selection for word of the year.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>Research and understand your audience.</li>
            <li>Establish your tone using copy guidelines.</li>
            <li>Establish your business objectives (what your copy aims to achieve).</li>
            <li>Conceptualize the angle you will take to get this across in your copy and meet your business objectives.</li>
            <li>Write the framework, that is, the &lt;h1&gt; tags that will dictate the hierarchy of the content as well as a powerful title. Then elaborate in the body of the copy under the subheadings.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Things to Avoid</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s05_p01">Even if you are a brilliant copywriter, the moment you stop sticking to online copy rules and regulations, your writing will hold very little weight on the search engine. These are some of the examples of bad practice that can have some very serious repercussions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keyword stuffing</strong>. If you try to squash too many targeted phrases or keywords into a piece of copy, the search engine spiders will immediately pick this up, and you will stand the chance of being wiped right off the SERPs. Keyword stuffing makes copy sound forced and unnatural and is unpleasant to read. Stick to relevant content that offers the readers real value; this will naturally attract links and visitors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Misrepresented titles</strong>. Titles are often the first touch points that readers come across before deciding to pursue a page of copy. Therefore, they need to encompass what the page is about and get the gist of the content. Be sure to be true to your title; otherwise readers will feel cheated and taken advantage of and there is a strong chance that they will not want to visit again. Misrepresented titles breed mistrust—avoid this at all costs!</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Irrelevant content</strong>. No reader wants to go through the mission of searching a search engine only to land on a page that has no relevance to him. Your content will be seen as waffle, and you will lose authority as a credible source—in fact, you will probably chase many visitors away.</li>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s04_s05_l02">
                <li>Copywriting for SEO involves optimizing copy for select key phrases in order to give context to search engines. A page can be optimized for up to five key phrases, but it is usually optimized for three of them. SEO copywriting involves the metadata and title tags, as well as the copy that is read on a page.</li>
                <li>The dynamic nature of the Internet means that new words are entering a user’s vocabulary every day. For best copywriting, know your audience and use the language that resonates most strongly with them.</li>
