    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p01">Quantitative research gathers data that can be statistically analyzed to determine results. Data must be formally gathered and should be collected to test a hypothesis as opposed to determine a hypothesis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Qualitative data</a><span class="glossdef">Data that can be observed but not measured. Deal with descriptions.</span></span> can be more difficult to quantify. Typically, because base sizes are smaller and not necessarily representative of the market under investigation (as it can be more expensive and time consuming to gather and analyze the data), qualitative data cannot be taken as quantified. They are, however, valuable in aiding a researcher in interpreting the market perspective. It is possible to combine approaches, producing data that can be used both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p04">For example, in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online reputation management (ORM)</a><span class="glossdef">The understanding and influencing of the perception of an entity online. This entails ensuring that you know what is being said about you and that you are leading the conversation.</span></span>, tools exist that can track brand-name mentions. These data can then be analyzed qualitatively, where researchers can examine the mentions and use their judgment to determine sentiment, or quantitatively, where mentions can be assigned numeric values across a range of categories that are used to generate a reputation score, such as BrandsEye’s online reputation algorithm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p05">When both qualitative and quantitative research are used, usually qualitative research takes place first to get an idea of the issues to be aware of, and then quantitative research tests the theories put forward in qualitative research.</p>

If your business transacts both online and offline, beware that using only online channels for market research might not be representative of your target market. However, if your business transacts only online, offline channels for your market research are less necessary.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_s02_p03">Web analytics packages are a prime source of data. Using data such as search terms, referral URLs (uniform resource locators), and internal search data can lead to qualitative assumptions about the consumers visiting a Web site. However, when data are measurable and specific, such as impressions and click-through rates, this leads to quantitative data.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_s02_s02_p01">Research panels and research communities are two means for conducting research. Whereas research panels are primarily used when conducting qualitative research, research communities primarily provide <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quantitative data</a><span class="glossdef">Data that can be measured or defined. Deal with numbers.</span></span>. The Internet comes to the fore when considering research communities, as social media such as social networks and blogs already provide the framework for people to connect and interact with each other. Most panels, whether online or offline, are not about member-to-member interaction. Research panels seek to address the “what” using surveys to gather quantitative data. Research communities primarily use discussions, driven online by blogs and other media sharing communities.</p>
