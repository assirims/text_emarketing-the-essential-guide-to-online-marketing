<span class="title-prefix">7.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p01">Pay-per-click (PPC) advertising is an advertising system where the advertisers pay only for each click on their advertisements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p02">While it is most often used as an advertising system offered by search engines, such as Yahoo! and Google, it can also be used for banner advertising (where the advertiser pays for clicks on the advertisement as opposed to impressions). PPC is also the system on which many shopping engines and directories, such as NexTag and Shopping.com, are based. Sometimes PPC advertising on search engines is referred to as paid search.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p03">PPC advertising revolutionized the online advertising industry, and today, advertising generates 97 percent of Google’s revenue. Google’s revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2008, was $5.19 billion, and that figure continues to increase.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn07_001">Rob Hof, “Google Defies the Naysayers,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, April 17, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/04/google.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_techbeat">http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/04/google.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_techbeat</a> (accessed June 18, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p04">In this chapter, we’ll use PPC to refer to paid-search advertising, that is, PPC advertising provided by search engines, but we will touch briefly on other advertising systems based on PPC.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p05">PPC advertisements on search engines are easy to spot—they’re the results listed as “sponsored links.” They can appear on the top of the results page, usually in a box, and also on the right-hand side of the results page.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p06">PPC advertising is keyword based—this means that it is based on the search term that a user enters into a search engine. A search term can have one word or be made up of many words. Sometimes a multiword search term is referred to as a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key phrase</a><span class="glossdef">A multiword keyword.</span></span>” or “keyword phrase.” Advertisers target those keywords for which they want their advertisement to appear.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_p07">For the advertiser, the beauty of PPC advertising on search engines is that their advertisements are displayed when potential customers are already expressing intent—they are searching for a product or service. It allows advertisers to present their offering to a potential customer who is already in the buying cycle.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02_p01">You have learned that search engines display results to search queries based on proprietary algorithms. Each major search engine uses its own formula to determine what results to display for any term. All of this is available to Web users for free! With about 80 percent of Web users using search engines as a starting point,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn07_002">Bernard Jansen and Paulo Molino, “The Effectiveness of Web Search Engines for Retrieving Relevant Ecommerce Links,” <em class="emphasis">Information Processing and Management</em> 42 (2006): 1077, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ist.psu.edu/faculty_pages/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_ecommerce_ipm2006.pdf">http://ist.psu.edu/faculty_pages/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_ecommerce_ipm2006.pdf</a> (accessed April 3, 2008).</span> that’s a lot of traffic going through search engines each day. So search engines require a way of generating revenue from all that traffic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02_p02">In 1996, the Open Text Index search engine began allowing Web sites to pay for a preferred ranking in selected results pages, to mixed response from business owners and other search engines. However, this was pay for placement, not that different from paid inclusion, where advertisers were paying to appear in the search results, whether or not a user clicked through to their site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02_p03">In February 1998, GoTo.com was launched. This was a new search engine that allowed Web site owners to bid for placement in the search results pages for specific search terms. Results were ranked according to how much the Web site owners were willing to bid, with the highest bid appearing at the top of the page. The Web site owner would only pay for each click, as opposed to for appearing on the results page. By July 1998, advertisers were paying up to a dollar for each click! GoTo.com changed its name to Overture Services, Inc., in 2001, and was acquired by Yahoo! in 2003. GoTo.com partnered with the portals Yahoo! and MSN to monetize their search queries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02_p04">Overture successfully patented their PPC mechanism for search engines (“system and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine” was patented in 2001) and has since then pursued, successfully, lawsuits against other PPC providers, including Google.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn07_003">Danny Sullivan, “Overture Files Lawsuit against Google,” Search Engine Watch, May 6, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://searchenginewatch.com/2164761">http://searchenginewatch.com/2164761</a> (accessed June 18, 2010).</span> Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent in 2002 and settled with Google after it had been acquired by Yahoo! Google agreed to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s01_s02_p05">Google started search engine advertising in December 1999 and launched AdWords in October 2000. AdWords allowed advertisers to place keyword-targeted listings but charged advertisers on a CPM (cost per mille) basis. Google launched PPC advertising in February 2002, and today, advertising accounts for about 99 percent of Google’s revenue.</p>

While the basic process remains the same for each one, there are some differences.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_p02">With PPC advertising, the advertiser does the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_l02">
        <li>Creates the content for an advertisement</li>
        <li>Selects the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">keywords</a><span class="glossdef">This is a word found within a search query. For example, searching for “blue widgets” includes the keywords “blue” and “widgets.”</span></span> for which that advertisement should appear</li>
        <li>Chooses the maximum amount they are willing to pay for a click on the advertisement (this amount can be unique to each keyword they have selected for an advertisement)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_p03">The search engine algorithm does the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_l03">
        <li>Checks the advertisement for compliance to editorial guidelines</li>
        <li>Displays the advertisement for relevant search queries</li>
        <li>Determines the rank, or position, of the advertisement based on the advertiser’s maximum bid and the relevance of the advertisement (which includes factors such as click-through rate [CTR], ad copy, keywords, and landing-page relevance to the search)</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Advertisers can choose to have their advertisements displayed on the search network only (which means on search engines), or they can select to have the advertisements displayed on the content network.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s02_p02">The search network will include the search engine that owns the platform (so Google for AdWords), as well as other search engines for which that platform provides paid results (e.g., currently Ask.com uses the AdWords platform for paid results).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p06">The URL (uniform resource locator) shown is not necessarily the URL that the user will click through to. When writing the copy, these are known as the display URL (what is shown on the advertisement) and the destination URL (what the actual URL of the page is). The display URL is sometimes also called a vanity URL. The aim should be to send users to a Web page as specific to their search, and the PPC advertisement, as possible. This is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deep linking</a><span class="glossdef">Making a hyperlink that points to a specific page or image on another Web site instead of that Web site’s main or home page.</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p01">Advertisers need to determine the maximum they are willing to pay for a click on their advertisement, and they need to decide this for each keyword they enter for an advertisement. This bid is the maximum CPC (cost per click), or max CPC, that the advertiser is willing to pay for the click.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_n01">

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p02">A Vickrey auction is an auction where bidders do not know what bids others have placed. It is a sealed auction. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism is the generalization of the Vickrey auction that holds that bidders will bid truthfully. In PPC advertising, this is not always the case. Bidders sometimes bid to push prices for their competition instead of to maximize their own revenue.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p03">However, this will not necessarily be the CPC that the advertiser must pay for a click. Every time a search query is entered, the search engine runs an auction to determine the placement of the advertisements where advertisers have bid on that search term. This auction is known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generalized second price (GSP)</a><span class="glossdef">Auction type that search engines are modeled after.</span></span> auction, which is a variation on the Vickrey auction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p04">In the GSP auction, each advertiser will pay the bid of the advertiser below him, plus a standard increment (typically $0.01), for a click on the advertisement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p05">Say three advertisers, A1, A2, and A3, bid $2.50, $3.00, and $2.35, respectively, on the same keyword.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p06">When it comes to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ranking</a><span class="glossdef">Process by which search engines display Web sites so that the most relevant Web sites appear on the top. Search engine optimization is a technique by which high rankings may be obtained.</span></span>, of course, it’s not quite as simplistic as that. As well as the bid an advertiser places on a keyword, the search engine will take a number of other factors into account. In the case of Google AdWords, this is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quality Score</a><span class="glossdef">Google’s basis for determining the minimum bids for keywords, based on relevancy and historical data.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p07">The Quality Score is determined by the following, among other factors:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>The relevance of the keyword to the search term</li>
            <li>The relevance of the advertisement copy to the search term</li>
            <li>The relevance of the landing page to the search term</li>
            <li>The historic <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click-through rate (CTR)</a><span class="glossdef">Clicks divided by impression percent.</span></span> of that advertisement</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p08">Search engines look at factors such as relevancy to try to ensure that it is not just having deep pockets that can land advertisers the top spot. Search engines need to ensure that users find the advertisements relevant, otherwise they’ll be less likely to click on them—and no click means no revenue for the search engine.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p02">Looking at the heat map, you can see that getting in the blue box on Google will most likely generate even more clicks on an advertisement. You might think the more clicks the better, but is this necessarily the case?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p03">Being in the top position means you will pay more per click. Many clicks at a higher price may use up your budget quickly. Also, many people click on the top advertisement believing it to be the top organic search result—often without reading the advertisement text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p04">Advertisers need to consider what a user does after clicking through to the advertiser’s Web site from the search engine. When planning a PPC campaign, it is therefore crucial to set up the goals of the campaign and make sure that these are being met. You can use your analytics package to set these up. With a goal set up, the advertiser can track how many of the users that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click through</a><span class="glossdef">A click on a link that leads to another Web site.</span></span> to the Web site follow through to that goal. This is called a conversion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p05">Goals can be any of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Buying a product</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p06">We know that the CTR of an advertisement is the percentage of clicks divided by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impression</a><span class="glossdef">Each time the advertisement is shown.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p07">The conversion rate of an advertisement is the percentage of conversions divided by click.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p08">As the advertiser, you also need to know the value of each conversion.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Example B</strong>. Bid on the same keyword with phrase match, but bid for a higher position.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Example C</strong>. Bid on the same keyword, but with broad match this time. Because the traffic is less targeted, the conversion rate on the Web site is lower. This means that the CPA increases again.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p10">The campaign needs to be run according to business rules. A PPC campaign can aim for maximum conversions, but this is usually at a higher CPA.</p>

You can set daily budgets, monthly budgets, or no budget. Once your budget is reached, your advertisements are paused, so you can be sure that you never overspend. If you are concerned about overspending, you can set a daily budget. However, this can mean that your advertisements do not run as often as you would wish them to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s05_p02">The different advertising platforms offer advanced bidding options, all aimed at helping you to run your advertising campaign better.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p01">There is some theory that different platforms are better for different industries. For example, some believe that Yahoo! fares better than Google on travel advertising. However, this is subjective, and most large advertisers will run PPC campaigns on a number of platforms. As with most things in eMarketing, it is all about testing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p02">There are some small differences with each platform in terms of editorial policy, and each system has a different user interface.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p03">Google AdWords also currently has the best geotargeting worldwide, although geotargeting is offered by both Microsoft adCenter and Yahoo! Search Marketing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s07_p01">Google has estimated that 50 percent of searches are unique. This means that the sum of unique searches is about the same as the sum of nonunique searches.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s02_p01">For a successful campaign, you need a full online and an offline analysis of the business, customer demographics, the industry, and competitors. While it is relatively quick to set up a campaign, preplanning will show dividends later. You need a brand, an identity, and a clear, unique selling point. You only get three lines to advertise, so you need to make sure you know what should be in there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Define Your Goals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s03_p01">You need to know what you want to achieve with your PPC (pay-per-click) campaign. Branding campaigns, for example, are very different from campaigns that increase sales. What do you want users to do once they click on your advertisement?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Determine Your Budget, Cost per Action, and Targets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s04_p01">Determine how much you are willing to spend to achieve your goal—your target cost per action (CPA). Decide how much budget you are going to allocate to your PPC campaign. If your goal is to increase revenue, your budget might be unlimited so long as revenue is increasing and you are within your target CPA.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Research Keywords</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p01">You need to determine what keywords potential customers are likely to use when searching for the service that you offer. Along with that, you need to know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_l01">
            <li>What common misspellings a customer might use</li>
            <li>What words would show that they are not likely to purchase from you (words like free and cheap)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p02">As part of your keyword research, you need to look at expected volumes for your keywords, so you know how to bid on keywords. See “Tools of the Trade” in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch07_s05#fwk-105454-ch07_s05">Section 7.5 "Online Comparison Engines"</a> for some suggestions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s05_p03">There are also tools that will show you similar or related keywords, so you can expand your keyword list even further. Again, find suggestions in “Tools of the Trade” in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch07_s05#fwk-105454-ch07_s05">Section 7.5 "Online Comparison Engines"</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 5: Write the Advertisements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06_p01">Using your keyword research, write compelling advertisements to promote your products. Advertisements can be unique to a keyword, or you can group them and have a number of keywords for one advertisement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s06_p02">Make sure you use an appropriate display URL (uniform resource locator) and that you target the landing page for each advertisement. Always include a call to action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 6: Place Your Bids</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s07_p01">Based on your goals and keyword research, set the maximum bids for your keywords. Don’t set these too high at this stage—you’ll tweak the bids as you test your campaign.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 7: Measure, Analyze, Test, Optimize!</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s08_p01">With conversion tracking in place, you can analyze your ROI (return on investment) down to a keyword level, and then focus on those keywords that are converting best. Consider seeing how changing the text of your advertisement can increase the CTR (click-through rate) or perhaps better your conversion rate. Test different landing pages to see what converts better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Landing Pages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p01">PPC advertising is not just about creating advertisements and bidding for keywords. The process continues once a user has clicked on your advertisement. The page that the user reaches by clicking on an advertisement is called a landing page.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p02">Landing pages can make or break an advertising campaign. Poorly executed PPC campaigns will send all users to the home page of a Web site. Campaigns that convert will make sure that users land on a page that is relevant to their search. The aim is to keep the user as focused on the goal—conversion—as possible. Sending the user to the home page gives him too many other options to choose from.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p03">For example, if someone searched for “Canon EOS 450D,” a poorly run campaign would send that user to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.canon.co.uk">http://www.canon.co.uk</a>. A better campaign would have the user clicking through to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_450D/index.asp">http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_450D/index.asp</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p04">Landing pages also indicate relevance to the search engine, which can increase the Quality Score of the advertisement, and in turn lower the CPC (cost per click) of the keyword. Adding pages to the Web site that are keyword rich can also carry SEO (search engine optimization) benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p05">PPC campaigns often have thousands of keywords, which can mean that there will be a lot of landing pages to be built! Creating <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dynamic landing pages</a><span class="glossdef">Unique, keyword-rich landing pages that can be created for each search using a simple script.</span></span> means that with a simple script, unique keyword-rich landing pages can be created for every search. The script will take the keyword that the searcher has used, and insert it in predefined places on the landing page. The user will then be landing on a page that is highly relevant to their search!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s04_s09_p06">Dynamic landing pages can be created with a simple script that will allow for a landing page to be created for every keyword in the PPC campaign.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p01">As we mentioned, PPC (pay per click) does not only apply to search engine advertising. We have seen that advertisements can be placed on content sites. PPC can also refer to display advertising, where advertisers pay only for each click-through to their site, as opposed to each impression of the banner. PPC is also used by many online comparison engines.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p02">You have probably come across online comparison engines when searching for a particular product. Popular comparison engines include the following:</p>

        <li>NexTag (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nextag.com">http://www.nextag.com</a>)</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p04">When a user searches for a product on one of the comparison engines, the engine will list all retailers who offer that product. When the engines contract the retailers, they also agree on how much the retailer is willing to pay for each click from the comparison engine through to the retailer’s Web site. The minimum CPC (cost per click) will vary from category to category (consumer electronics, for example, could have a higher CPC than baby clothes).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p05">When results are shown, priority is given to those retailers who are willing to pay a higher CPC. However, the user has the option of sorting results by price, alphabetically, and so on.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p06">Online comparison engines form an important part of the online marketing mix for an online retailer. As well as comparing products from different retailers, they also offer users the chance to review products as well as retailers. Many users prefer to start their product search on a comparison engine, as they can see a variety of prices for the same product in one place.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_l01">
            <li>Fully understand the benefits of PPC (pay per click) while also understanding the negatives.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_p01">PPC (pay-per-click) campaigns are relatively quick to set up, can provide high volumes of traffic, and are by nature highly trackable—what’s not to love? But there are some pitfalls that you ought to be aware of.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Click Fraud</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02_p01">Click fraud occurs when your advertisement is clicked on by someone who is not a legitimate potential customer. Because an advertiser has to pay for every click on his advertisement, sometimes unscrupulous competitors can click on the advertisement to force the payment. There are even automated bots that can click on advertisements, costing advertisers millions.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02_p02">Google said in February 2007 that click fraud accounts for only 0.02 percent of clicks. You can read more on its blog: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2007/02/invalid-clicks-googles-overall-numbers.html">http://adwords.blogspot.com/2007/02/invalid-clicks-googles-overall-numbers.html</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02_p03">The search engines, however, have taken measures to combat this. Advertisers can report suspected click fraud, and the search engines will refund invalid or fraudulent clicks after investigation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s02_p04">What can you do? Keep an eye on your campaign. Any sudden leap in CTRs (click-through rates) should be investigated, and you should pay particular attention to see if the conversion rate drops (which would indicate potential fraud) or stays the same. Pause the campaign if you suspect fraud, and alert the search engine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Bidding Wars and Climbing Costs per Click</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s03_p01">High-traffic keywords are expensive, and the battle to stay on top means that the CPC (cost per click) of these keywords is escalating. Convincing yourself that it’s number one or nothing can result in burning through your campaign budget quickly with nothing to show for it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s03_p02">What can you do? Keep focused on your campaign goals and ROI (return on investment), and keep investigating to find the (cheaper) niche keywords that work for you.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Required to Keep an Eye on Things</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s04_p01">PPC campaigns require a lot of monitoring, and the bigger your campaign gets, the more time this takes. PPC advertising can provide a fantastic ROI, but you need to check in and tweak regularly to make sure that it continues to perform for you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s04_p02">What can you do? Make sure that you have allocated the time required to run a successful campaign. There are also tools available that make managing large campaigns easier. But remember the following good reasons (and many, many more) why PPC works for you:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s06_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">No- to low-cost barrier</strong>. You only pay for traffic; there are minimal setup fees involved.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tracking every cent</strong>. PPC advertising allows you to track your advertising spending down to a keyword level, so you can learn what works and what doesn’t on a small scale.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Targeted advertisement placement</strong>. You can make your advertising relevant with the many filters available when selecting where to show your advertisements.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Giving your customers what they want</strong>. PPC advertising lets you place your advertisement in front of people who are searching for your product. It lets you provide a solution, as opposed to creating an interruption. What more could you want?</li>

<span class="title-prefix">7.7</span> Case Study: Southern Sun</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p01">Southern Sun (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.southernsun.com">http://www.southernsun.com</a>) launched a new Web site in May 2006. The changes included an updated look and feel, a greater quantity and quality of information, and better booking functionality. As often happens with a site relaunch, Southern Sun lost all the previously good organic search engine rankings. A new Web site needs time to climb up the search engine rankings, and it can take a minimum of three months before it starts receiving organic traffic. Southern Sun could potentially have lost out on bookings because of the decrease in organic traffic. Therefore, they required a way of ensuring that their site still did the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l01">
        <li>Continued to receive a steady flow of bookings despite temporarily poor organic rankings</li>
        <li>Received enough traffic to analyze user behavior and responses</li>
        <li>Received enough traffic to generate trust from search engines and climb up the SERPs (search engine results pages) as fast as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p02">With the new site, Southern Sun hoped to increase the number of bookings made online and to tap into the international-tourist and business-travel market. This meant they needed to migrate a significant amount of their offline promotions and special offers to their Web site in such a way as to attract a favorable online response.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p03">Quirk eMarketing, the online agency for Southern Sun, set up a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign with the following intentions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l02">
        <li>Sending traffic to the site</li>
        <li>Attracting international traffic</li>
        <li>Split-testing campaigns</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p04">Separate campaigns were built for the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l03">
        <li>Local versus international traffic</li>
        <li>Brand- and hotel-specific versus place-specific traffic</li>
        <li>Special offers and campaigns versus normal traffic</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p05">Quirk did an extensive keyword research exercise to identify high-traffic-generating keywords in order to get as much traffic as possible, as well as niche long-tail keywords for better cost per conversion. Keywords specific to Southern Sun’s various customer groups were targeted, such as families, business travelers, couples, and tourists.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p06">Furthermore, advertisements were set up that tested the best marketing message, that is, whether people responded best to the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l04">
        <li>The Southern Sun brand</li>
        <li>A special offer</li>
        <li>A wide variety of hotels and brands</li>
        <li>Location and convenience</li>
        <li>Facilities</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p07">As a result, Quirk could assess whether different groups of people were influenced by different advertisements, as keyword research had been done according to customer groups.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p08">In order to determine whether people responded better to special offers and campaigns or just hotel and area details, landing-page split tests were conducted. Tracking for various different stages of the hotel-booking process was implemented, including the hotel room quote and the final thank-you-for-payment page so that it would become evident where any drop-offs occurred.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p09">One of the great advantages of PPC is that it gets immediate results. As soon as the new site went live, so did the PPC campaign, which meant traffic from day one. The traffic generated by the PPC advertising ensured that the site was noticed by search engines and was trusted as a valid South African hotel site.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p10">Split testing revealed some very interesting and useful behaviors and trends:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l05">
        <li>The overall best response was to the advertisements containing the Southern Sun brand, particularly from the local South African market. This was very positive for Southern Sun and gave them a distinct PPC advantage with regard to Google’s quality, as it meant high click-through on competitive key phrases like “Cape Town hotels.” It also showed that its brand was not as well recognized in the United Kingdom and the United States.</li>
        <li>Search marketing is driven by meeting a need, whereas offline marketing involves creating a need. Split testing picked up that the (very successful) offline marketing campaigns were not so successful when actively marketed through PPC and that they do better when advertised from within the Web site. The campaign had an average booking rate of 0.38 percent. The landing pages that supplied a list of hotels in an area or offering a service far outperformed this, with an average booking rate of 3.45 percent.</li>
        <li>International traffic responded differently to various offers and hotel details compared to local traffic. In general, there was a better response locally with an ROI (return on investment) of 780 percent versus 430 percent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_p11">Running a PPC campaign when you launch or relaunch a site will do the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s07_l06">
        <li>Attract enough traffic to ensure you don’t lose business</li>
        <li>Test site structure and browser behavior</li>
        <li>Allow you to assess where traffic comes from, so you can test and optimize presentation of your product to your customers</li>
