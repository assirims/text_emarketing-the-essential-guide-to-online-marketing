    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_p01">We’ll take a look at keyword selection when we go through the process of setting up a campaign, but first you need to know a little bit more about the different ways we can define keywords in a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_p02">Each search engine requires the advertiser to enter the keywords for which their advertisement should appear. This list of keywords determines the search queries for which the advertisements could appear.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_p04">Google AdWords uses the following match types:</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_p08">Phrase match, which is denoted with quotation marks around the keywords (“phrase match”) means that your advertisement will appear only for search terms that have your keywords in them, in the same order, though other words may also be in the search term.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_p09">If you changed the same keywords to phrase match, they would look like the following:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s02_p01">You are able to target your campaigns, so you know that the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">traffic</a><span class="glossdef">This refers to the visitors that visit a Web site.</span></span> you are getting is relevant to your product.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s02_p02">You can choose the language of the search engine and the location. For example, you might only want your advertisement to show to English searches in Asia, or to English searches in London.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Bidding and Ranking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p01">Advertisers need to determine the maximum they are willing to pay for a click on their advertisement, and they need to decide this for each keyword they enter for an advertisement. This bid is the maximum CPC (cost per click), or max CPC, that the advertiser is willing to pay for the click.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p02">A Vickrey auction is an auction where bidders do not know what bids others have placed. It is a sealed auction. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism is the generalization of the Vickrey auction that holds that bidders will bid truthfully. In PPC advertising, this is not always the case. Bidders sometimes bid to push prices for their competition instead of to maximize their own revenue.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p03">However, this will not necessarily be the CPC that the advertiser must pay for a click. Every time a search query is entered, the search engine runs an auction to determine the placement of the advertisements where advertisers have bid on that search term. This auction is known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">generalized second price (GSP)</a><span class="glossdef">Auction type that search engines are modeled after.</span></span> auction, which is a variation on the Vickrey auction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p04">In the GSP auction, each advertiser will pay the bid of the advertiser below him, plus a standard increment (typically $0.01), for a click on the advertisement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p05">Say three advertisers, A1, A2, and A3, bid $2.50, $3.00, and $2.35, respectively, on the same keyword. The search engine has set a minimum price of $2.05 on that same keyword. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_f01">Figure 7.6 "Example of Advertisers Bidding on the Same Keyword"</a> shows how the advertisements would be positioned and what they would each pay for a click.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p06">When it comes to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ranking</a><span class="glossdef">Process by which search engines display Web sites so that the most relevant Web sites appear on the top. Search engine optimization is a technique by which high rankings may be obtained.</span></span>, of course, it’s not quite as simplistic as that. As well as the bid an advertiser places on a keyword, the search engine will take a number of other factors into account. In the case of Google AdWords, this is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Quality Score</a><span class="glossdef">Google’s basis for determining the minimum bids for keywords, based on relevancy and historical data.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p07">The Quality Score is determined by the following, among other factors:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>The relevance of the keyword to the search term</li>
            <li>The relevance of the advertisement copy to the search term</li>
            <li>The relevance of the landing page to the search term</li>
            <li>The historic <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click-through rate (CTR)</a><span class="glossdef">Clicks divided by impression percent.</span></span> of that advertisement</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s03_p08">Search engines look at factors such as relevancy to try to ensure that it is not just having deep pockets that can land advertisers the top spot. Search engines need to ensure that users find the advertisements relevant, otherwise they’ll be less likely to click on them—and no click means no revenue for the search engine.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p01">Studies repeatedly show that those advertisements nearer the top of the page (so the best ranked) attract the highest CTRs (click-through rates). They get the most clicks. And the clicks cost the advertisers more.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p02">Looking at the heat map, you can see that getting in the blue box on Google will most likely generate even more clicks on an advertisement. You might think the more clicks the better, but is this necessarily the case?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p03">Being in the top position means you will pay more per click. Many clicks at a higher price may use up your budget quickly. Also, many people click on the top advertisement believing it to be the top organic search result—often without reading the advertisement text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p04">Advertisers need to consider what a user does after clicking through to the advertiser’s Web site from the search engine. When planning a PPC campaign, it is therefore crucial to set up the goals of the campaign and make sure that these are being met. You can use your analytics package to set these up. With a goal set up, the advertiser can track how many of the users that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click through</a><span class="glossdef">A click on a link that leads to another Web site.</span></span> to the Web site follow through to that goal. This is called a conversion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p05">Goals can be any of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>Buying a product</li>

            <li>Downloading a white paper</li>
            <li>Sending an inquiry</li>
            <li>Booking a flight</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p06">We know that the CTR of an advertisement is the percentage of clicks divided by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">impression</a><span class="glossdef">Each time the advertisement is shown.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p07">The conversion rate of an advertisement is the percentage of conversions divided by click.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p08">As the advertiser, you also need to know the value of each conversion. You need to know this so that you don’t pay too much for your clicks, and so that you bid to have the best CTR for maximum <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">return on investment (ROI)</a><span class="glossdef">The ratio of cost to profit (e.g., advertising spending as a percentage of the revenue that it generates).</span></span>.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Example B</strong>. Bid on the same keyword with phrase match, but bid for a higher position.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Example C</strong>. Bid on the same keyword, but with broad match this time. Because the traffic is less targeted, the conversion rate on the Web site is lower. This means that the CPA increases again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s04_p10">The campaign needs to be run according to business rules. A PPC campaign can aim for maximum conversions, but this is usually at a higher CPA.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s05_p01">As well as deciding on your CPC bids for your keywords, you are able to determine the budgets for your campaign. You can set daily budgets, monthly budgets, or no budget. Once your budget is reached, your advertisements are paused, so you can be sure that you never overspend. If you are concerned about overspending, you can set a daily budget. However, this can mean that your advertisements do not run as often as you would wish them to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s05_p02">The different advertising platforms offer advanced bidding options, all aimed at helping you to run your advertising campaign better.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p01">There is some theory that different platforms are better for different industries. For example, some believe that Yahoo! fares better than Google on travel advertising. However, this is subjective, and most large advertisers will run PPC campaigns on a number of platforms. As with most things in eMarketing, it is all about testing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p02">There are some small differences with each platform in terms of editorial policy, and each system has a different user interface. Google AdWords, perhaps the most well known, allows users to transact in the currency of their choice and also offers training programs and certifications.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s06_p03">Google AdWords also currently has the best geotargeting worldwide, although geotargeting is offered by both Microsoft adCenter and Yahoo! Search Marketing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s07_p01">Google has estimated that 50 percent of searches are unique. This means that the sum of unique searches is about the same as the sum of nonunique searches. Looking a little more closely at search terms will show a small number of high-volume searches, and then a large number of lower volume searches stretching out to those unique searches.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s07_p02">This is sometimes referred to as the long tail of search. Figuring out those low-volume, niche search terms can do wonders for a PPC campaign. Generally there is not much competition for those search terms, and the search term itself is very targeted.</p>

                <li>Advertisers can define keywords for which their ad should appear.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Google uses the following match types:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s07_l02">
                        <li>Broad</li>
                        <li>Phrase</li>
                        <li>Exact</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Advertisers can assign as many keywords as they wish to an ad, but only one ad for each URL (uniform resource locator) can be shown.</li>
                <li>Advertisers can target by location and language for added relevancy.</li>
                <li>Advertisers can determine the maximum they are willing to pay for a click on their ad. This is known as bidding, and it determines ranking.</li>
                <li>Every time a search query is entered, the search engine runs an auction to determine the placement of the advertisements where advertisers have bid on that search term.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">The Quality Score is determined by four main factors:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s03_s07_l03">
                        <li>The relevance of the keyword to the search term</li>

                        <li>The relevance of the landing page to the search term</li>
                        <li>The historic CTR (click-through rate) of that advertisement</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many things in a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign that can affect conversion rates and CTRs. An advertiser needs to evaluate goals to see what is best.</li>
                <li>Budgets are based on CPC (cost-per-click) bids. Advertisers have flexibility in how their budgets run.</li>
                <li>Testing is essential in determining what search platform is best.</li>
                <li>It is important to consider long-tail keywords in a campaign.</li>
