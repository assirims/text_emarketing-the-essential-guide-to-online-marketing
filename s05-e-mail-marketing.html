<span class="title-prefix">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s01_p01">At its core, e-mail marketing is a tool for customer relationship management (CRM). Used effectively, this extension of permission-based marketing can deliver one of the highest returns on investment (ROI) of any eMarketing activity. Simply put, e-mail marketing is a form of direct marketing that utilizes electronic means to deliver commercial messages to an audience. It is one of the oldest and yet still one of the most powerful of all eMarketing tactics. The power comes from the fact that it is the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s01_l01">
        <li>Extremely cost effective due to a low cost per contact</li>
        <li>Highly targeted</li>
        <li>Customizable on a mass scale</li>
        <li>Completely measurable</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s01_p02">Furthermore, e-mail marketing’s main strength is that it takes advantage of a customer’s most prolific touch point with the Internet: their in-box. E-mail marketing is a tool for building relationships with both existing and potential customers. It should maximize the retention and value of these customers, which should ultimately lead to greater profitability.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s02_p01">E-mail is probably ubiquitous to you, but there was a time when there was no e-mail!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s02_p02">E-mail actually predates the Internet and was first used way back in 1961 as a way for users of the same computer to leave messages for each other. Ray Tomlinson is credited with creating the first network e-mail application in 1971. He initiated the use of the “@” sign and the address structure that we use today (username@hostname).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn02_001">Dave Crocker, “Email History,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingInternet.com/e/ei.htm">http://www.livingInternet.com/e/ei.htm</a> (accessed March 18, 2008).</span> E-mail was used to send messages to computers on the same network and is still used for this purpose today.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s02_p03">It was only in 1993 that large network service providers, such as America Online and Delphi, started to connect their proprietary e-mail systems to the Internet. This began the large-scale adoption of Internet e-mail as a global standard. Coupled with standards that had been created in the preceding twenty years, the Internet allowed users on different networks to send each other messages.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s02_p04">The first e-mail <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spam</a><span class="glossdef">E-mail sent to someone who has not requested to receive it—evil!</span></span> dates back to 1978. Spam is defined as unsolicited commercial or bulk e-mail. In fact, more than 97 percent of all e-mails sent over the Net are spam!<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn02_002">Darren Waters, “Spam Overwhelms E-mail Messages,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, April 8, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7988579.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7988579.stm</a> (accessed May 7, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s02_p05">Direct marketing has long played an integral part in marketing campaigns, but the high cost meant that only large companies were able to pursue it. However, with the growth of the Internet, and the use of e-mail to market directly to consumers, marketers have found these costs dropping and the effectiveness increasing.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p01">If you consider marketing as communicating with current and potential customers, you will see that every e-mail that is sent from your organization should be considered as part of your holistic e-mail marketing strategy. Does that sound a little complicated? Consider an online retailer, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.zappos.com">http://www.zappos.com</a>. Zappos is an online shoe retailer. What are the ways that, as a customer, you might receive e-mails from Zappos?</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Transactional e-mails</strong>. When you place an order, there will be a number of e-mails that you receive, from confirmation of your order to notice of shipping. Should you need to return an item, you will no doubt communicate with Zappos via e-mail.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Newsletters</strong>. These are e-mails that are sent to provide information and keep customers informed. They do not necessarily carry an overt promotion but instead ensure that a customer is in regular contact with the brand. These build relationships and foster trust between customers and their chosen brands.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promotional e-mails</strong>. Should Zappos have a summer sale, they will send an e-mail relating directly to that promotion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p02">The following are examples of other e-mails sent by Zappos:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_l03">
        <li><strong class="emphasis bold">E-mails to suppliers</strong></li>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p03">All the communication sent out can be used to convey your marketing message. Every touch point will market the organization. However, here we will focus on commercial e-mails.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s03_p04">There are two types of commercial e-mails:</p>

        <li>

These will probably be in line with the goals of your Web site, with e-mail marketing being used as a tool to help you achieve those goals. As discussed in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch14#fwk-105454-ch14">Chapter 15 "Web Analytics and Conversion Optimization"</a>, you will decide on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Also known as key success indicators (KSIs), these help an organization define and measure progress toward organizational goals.</span></span> for your campaign as well.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s02_p02">Newsletters tend to focus on longer-term goals, and so your KPIs become more important here. KPIs include the following:</p>

Bear in mind, though, that sometimes HTML e-mails are rendered as text e-mails.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_p02">Text e-mails are the plain ones—text only, as the name suggests. If you have a Windows computer and you open up Notepad and type there, then you will be creating a text file. These e-mails are smaller and plainer. While copy is always important, it is particularly critical in this case, as it is the key driver of action and interaction.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_p03">HTML e-mails are the e-mails with all the bells and whistles. These e-mails can contain images, different fonts, and hyperlinks. It’s probably what you’ve had in mind throughout this chapter when we have referred to e-mail marketing.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Parts of an E-mail</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p01">There are six main parts of an e-mail.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Header</a><span class="glossdef">Has the “to,” “from,” and “reply to” fields in an e-mail.</span></span>. This has the “to,” “from,” and “reply to” fields. These are also opportunities to build a relationship through creating a perception of familiarity. In other words, the reader needs to perceive that the newsletter is somewhat unique for them and sent personally by the publisher. Using a personalized company e-mail address (e.g., trevor@companyname.com) for the “reply” field creates familiarity and builds trust with the reader. The “from” address should also include the organization’s name. A meaningless “from” address that the reader cannot identify only serves to confuse the origin of the newsletter and spark apprehension.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Subject line</a><span class="glossdef">Aids the reader in identifying the e-mail and also entice the reader to open it.</span></span>. The subject line could be considered the most important part of an e-mail. Subject lines aid the reader in identifying the e-mail and also entice the reader to open it. The subject line is also scrutinized by spam filters and so should avoid words like “free,” “win,” and “buy now.” Consistent subject lines, using the name of the company and the newsletter edition, can build familiarity and help readers to sort their in-box. As with everything online, testing different subject lines will lead marketers to the formula that works for them.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personalized greeting</a><span class="glossdef">A greeting that is specific to the user.</span></span>. With a database that has entries for readers’ names, it is possible to personalize the greeting of the e-mail. “Hi, Kim Morgan” can elicit far better responses than “Dear Valued Customer,” but it is possible to create a greeting with personality without personalizing it. Occasionally, the subject line can be personalized as well to boost responses.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Body</a><span class="glossdef">Where the content of the e-mail goes.</span></span>. This is where the content of the e-mail goes. Don’t be tempted to use too many images: it can increase the size of the e-mail, and it can obscure text when images do not load. Be sure that text is not on the image but rather can be read without an image being loaded. Readers want value, so where images are used, make sure they are relevant and not just space fillers.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s02_s04_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Footer</a><span class="glossdef">Appears at the bottom of the e-mail and may include content such as contact information and the unsubscribe link.</span></span>. A standard footer for e-mails helps to build consistency, and is the customary place to keep the contact details of the company sending the e-mail. At the very least, this should include the name and contact e-mail of the company. It can also include the privacy policy of the sender. One way to grow the e-mail list is add a “forward to a friend” link in the footer. The most important part of the footer is a clear unsubscribe link.</p>

Required element for all e-mails.</span></span>. It is mandatory to have an unsubscribe link on all commercial e-mails. Interactive e-mails are best constructed with lightweight HTML capability allowing the e-mail to open quickly. This helps to capture the user’s attention before she moves on. The structure must allow readers to scan and navigate the e-mail easily. For more on usability, refer to <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch12#fwk-105454-ch12">Chapter 13 "Web Site Development and Design"</a>. The length of paragraphs, emphasis through bolding and colors, as well as sectioning information with bullets and borders all contribute to a well-structured e-mail.</p>

Some are Web based, like Gmail and Hotmail, but there are also plenty of software-based e-mail clients, like Outlook, Thunderbird, Eudora, and Lotus, to mention just a few. Theoretically, the same e-mail could look different in every single one of these, so be prepared. In addition to testing the e-mail to ensure that it will pass spam filters, the design should be tested to ensure that it renders clearly in as many e-mail clients as possible. Make sure that images line up, that copy is clear, and that all the links work.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s02_p02">Customization starts at using the recipient’s name and sending either HTML or text e-mails based on preference, to sophisticated measurement of a recipient’s preferences and tailoring content to suit them.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_p01">By creating valuable content, establishing the correct frequency, and testing an e-mail for display and deliverability, an e-mail marketer should be able to ensure an excellent delivery rate. Consistency in deploying newsletters also aids in fostering trust and fulfilling expectation. E-mails should be delivered at consistent times, but the optimum time for best results should be tested.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_p02">E-mail reputation can determine whether or not your message is regarded as spam. It is determined by the general opinion of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet service providers (ISPs)</a><span class="glossdef">The company that is providing you with access to the Internet (e.g., MWEB, AOL, and Yahoo!).</span></span>, the antispam community, and the recipients of an e-mail. It can relate to a sender’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Internet protocol (IP) address</a><span class="glossdef">An exclusive number that is used to represent every single computer in a network.</span></span>, sending domain, or both. This means that if someone sends e-mail using the same server that you use, you could be damaged if they spam. This opinion is a reputation score created by an ISP or a third-party provider. If the sender’s score falls within the ISP’s thresholds, a sender’s messages will be delivered to the in-box. If not, the sender’s e-mails may arrive in the bulk folder, be quarantined, or be bounced back to the sender.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_p03">Becoming an effective e-mail marketer requires constant list cleansing and hygiene. In fact, most lists shrink by 15 percent each year due to subscribers changing e-mail addresses. Make sure you are diligent about maintaining a current opt-in list to achieve maximum deliverability via reputation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_p04">Tips to help a reputation score include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>ISPs offer various sender’s authentication standards such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sender ID</a><span class="glossdef">A method used by major ISPs to confirm that e-mails do originate from the domain from which it claims to have been sent.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sender policy framework (SPF)</a><span class="glossdef">An extension of SMTP that stops e-mail spammers from forging the “From” fields in an e-mail.</span></span>, and DomainKeys. Use these.</li>
                <li>Out with the old, in with the new—keep your database clean.</li>
                <li>Remove <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hard bounces</a><span class="glossdef">The failed delivery of e-mail communication due to an unchanging reason like a nonexistent e-mail address.</span></span> after three deliveries (ISPs don’t like e-mail broadcasters who have a high bounce rate).</li>
                <li>Remember that a huge but inaccurate and outdated database is far less useful to an e-mail marketer than a tightly maintained, smaller database. Strive to boost your database, but don’t forget to clean it up as you go.</li>
                <li>Ensure e-mail broadcast rates are not too high.</li>
                <li>Respond to complaints and unsubscribe requests—if someone requests to be unsubscribed, do so.</li>
                <li>Educate users about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">white lists</a><span class="glossdef">A list of accepted e-mail addresses that an ISP, a subscriber, or other e-mail service provider allows to deliver messages regardless of spam filter settings.</span></span>.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s03_s03_p09">Permission must be explicitly given to the company to be allowed to market to that user.

Automated e-mails, such as order confirmations and even out of office replies, are all opportunities to engage with customers. If a company has a particular tone or content style, this must be reinforced in these interactions. These e-mails can also be an opportunity to cross-advertise other promotions that a company is offering.</p>

<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pass-on rate</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of e-mails that are forwarded.</span></span>. High pass-on rate (forwards) indicates that your list values the content enough to constantly share with others. Putting an easy “forward to a friend” link in every e-mail can increase this.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Click-through rates and conversion</strong>. This measures the effectiveness of an e-mail via the links placed in the content.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s04_s03_p04">All e-mails need to be tested for e-mail client compatibility as well as for any potential spam problems. E-mail client compatibility can be reviewed at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.litmusapp.com">http://www.litmusapp.com</a>, and an e-mail’s spam score can be checked at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://spamassassin.apache.org">http://spamassassin.apache.org</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s04_s03_p05">Once an e-mail has been sent, results need to be analyzed to pinpoint areas for growth for the next campaign.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s04_s03_l02">
                    <li>ROI can be a goal of the campaign, and it can be used as a KPI.</li>
                    <li>Growing a database, while keeping it targeted, is a key factor in any e-mail campaign.</li>
                    <li>Failure to obtain permission to send e-mails to a person may result in legal action or may jeopardize a company’s reputation. Gaining explicit permission to send e-mail marketing to a person is a prerequisite for successful e-mail marketing; however, all e-mails sent by an organization and the individuals in that organization can be seen as marketing opportunities.</li>
                    <li>There are six main parts of an e-mail: the header, subject line, personalized greeting, body, footer, and unsubscribe link.</li>
                    <li>Successful e-mail marketing requires careful planning and testing. HTML e-mails need to be tested across a range of e-mail clients and should be tested for a spam score before being deployed.</li>
                    <li>Being able to reconcile browsing activity to an e-mail recipient can give more opportunities for customization.</li>
                    <li>Valuable content should produce an excellent delivery rate.</li>
                    <li>The integrity of the database can be safeguarded with a double opt-in process.</li>
                    <li>Campaigns can track a certain level of data. These data can give insight into the success of the campaign.</li>

                <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch02_s04_s04_s03_l03">
                    <li>Why is it important for permission to be gained before marketing by e-mail to a prospect?</li>
                    <li>What are the parts of an e-mail? Why should all marketers follow this format? Why is unsubscribe functionality important? Can you guess what might happen if a marketer failed to include this feature?</li>
                    <li>As discussed in the text, marketers avoid words like “free,” “buy now,” and “discount” in order to prevent being marked as spam. What words might a marketer use instead?</li>
                    <li>E-mail list cleansing and hygiene is very important to any marketer. Review the reasons why it is important. What do you think would happen if list cleaning and hygiene techniques were not applied regularly?</li>
                    <li>A lot of testing goes into an e-mail marketing campaign. Describe one situation where testing is important. Describe how testing would improve campaign results in that particular situation.</li>
                    <li>What is meant by “mass customization” and why is this so beneficial?</li>
                    <li>E-mails that are expected and recognized are more likely to be read. How can a marketer use this knowledge to increase the readership of e-mails?</li>
                    <li>What do you think might be happening if you have high click-through rates but low conversion rates?</li>
                    <li>Why do you think it is important to test different factors in an e-mail? What knowledge does a marketer hope to gain?</li>
