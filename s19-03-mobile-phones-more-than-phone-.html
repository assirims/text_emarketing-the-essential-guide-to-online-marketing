        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s03_s02_p01">Just as the Web is used in a myriad of ways as a marketing, advertising, and distribution channel, so is the mobile phone. There are a number of technologies available to reach a mobile audience. Some of the most prevalent are detailed further.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s03_s02_p02">Mobile phones started as literally phones that are mobile (thank you again, Captain Obvious). Before we look at mobile phones as devices used to access the World Wide Web, to take photographs, or to make payments, we need to address their primary function: communication. The primary use of a mobile phone is to enable communication, either through voice calls or through messages. Messaging services on a mobile phone use either short message service (SMS) to send text messages or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multimedia message service (MMS)</a><span class="glossdef">An extension on SMS (short message service); allows picture, sound, or low-quality videos to be sent on a wireless network.</span></span> to send graphics, audio, photos, and video as well as text. Messages can, of course, also be sent via e-mail depending on the phoneâ€™s features.</p>
