<span class="title-prefix">10.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_p01">Word-of-mouth marketing is powerful. Edelman’s 2010 Trust Barometer shows that 44 percent of respondents trust “a person like me” as a spokesperson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn09_001">“Edelman Trust Barometer 2010,” Edelman, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.edelman.co.uk/trustbarometer/files/edelman-trust-barometer-2010.pdf">http://www.edelman.co.uk/trustbarometer/files/edelman-trust-barometer-2010.pdf</a> (accessed May 10, 2010).</span> In <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch08#fwk-105454-ch08">Chapter 8 "Social Media"</a>, you learned some of the ways that marketers can tap into the media that promote this kind of trust. Messages passed on from “a person like me” is word-of-mouth marketing, and online that same message can be passed on through social media.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_p02">Viral marketing is a form of word-of-mouth marketing that aims to result in a message spreading exponentially. It takes its name from a virus because of the similarities that marketers aim to emulate:</p>

        <li>It is easily passed on.</li>
        <li>The number of people who have been “infected” grows exponentially.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p01">The term “viral marketing” was probably first coined by Jeffrey Rayport in an article “The Virus of Marketing” in the December 1996 issue of <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn09_002">Jeffrey Rayport, “The Virus of Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 31, 1996, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/virus.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/virus.html</a> (accessed May 10, 2008).</span> That’s not to say that there weren’t viral marketing campaigns before that, but as the Internet developed, so have the electronic tools for passing on information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Word of mouth has existed as long as there have been words and mouths, but it is a fairly recent phenomenon in the world of marketing. Positive word of mouth can have a tremendous impact on a brand and can take up little to nothing of the marketing department’s budget. However, planning for and measuring word of mouth can be tricky and unpredictable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p03">As the connected nature of the Internet has allowed for easier spreading and tracking of word-of-mouth information, it has become possible to see how this can be modeled on the spread of a virus in a population.</p>
