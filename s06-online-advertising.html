<span class="title-prefix">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_p01">Simply put, online advertising is advertising on the Internet. Online advertising encompasses advertisements on search engine results pages, advertisements placed in e-mails, and other ways in which advertisers use the Internet. However, this chapter focuses on display advertising or rich-media advertising.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_p02">Whether online or off, the main objective of advertising is to increase sales. Advertising also aims to increase brand awareness. Advertising is based on the simple economics of supply and demand. Advertisers aim to stimulate a consumer need and then satisfy that need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_p03">One of the greatest benefits of online display advertising is that the messages are not restricted by geography or time. Online advertisements are also much more interactive than offline advertising. While both online and offline advertising can be disruptive, interactive online advertising can be designed to be perceived as less so.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_p04">Online display advertising began as simple hyperlinked images shown on a Web site and has since progressed to include video, sound, and many other modern technologies. Today, messages and interactions can be contained within the advertising display without ever taking consumers to a landing page.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_p05">Although the Internet provides new scope for creative approaches to advertising, we see its true advantage when we realize how trackable, and therefore measurable, Internet advertising is. Or, to take it from Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, “The Internet will transform advertising because of its trackability, not its beauty.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn03_001">Rebecca Lieb, “Immersive Advertising (Three Days’ Worth),” ClickZ, October 25, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=1488101">http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=1488101</a> (accessed May 1, 2008).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_s02_p01">Online advertising rapidly followed the developing Internet. And, as consumers are increasingly spending more time online, and hours spent on the Internet start to eclipse hours spent watching television, the medium becomes increasingly important to any advertiser.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s01_s02_p02">According to Wikipedia, the first clickable banner advertisement was sold to a law firm in 1993 by Global Network Navigator. HotWired, an early Web magazine, was the first to sell advertising space in large quantities to a number of advertisers. One of the very first advertisers was AT&amp;T (a U.S. telecom company), which went online in October 1994.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn03_002"><em class="emphasis">Wikipedia</em>, s.v. “Web Banner,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_banner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_banner</a> (accessed May 7, 2010).</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_p01">Advertising, whether online or offline, has a number of objectives:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_l02">
        <li>Building <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand awareness</a><span class="glossdef">Making sure someone is aware of a brand or product.</span></span>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Building Brand Awareness</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s02_p01">Making people aware of a brand or product is an important long-term goal for any marketer. Once customers know about the brand, the marketer has taken the first step toward gaining the customer’s trust and patronage. The better known a brand is, the more business they can do. And the ultimate goal is to do more business and sell more of the product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s02_p02">Online, creative advertising or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">banner</a><span class="glossdef">An online advertisement in the form of a graphic image that appears on a Web page.</span></span> advertising is largely visual, making it an ideal channel for promoting brand collateral.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Consumer Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s03_p01">Consumers can’t want what they don’t know about. Advertising needs to convince consumers about what they should want and why they should want it. Modern online advertising provides a great way to communicate the USPs (unique selling points) of a product, thereby helping stimulate demand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Satisfying Consumer Demand</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s04_p01">Once the consumer is aware of and desires a product, they need to find out how to satisfy that desire. If brand building has been effective, they will know that a particular brand exists. At this point, it is important for the marketer to show the consumer how their particular brand or product will best meet that need.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Driving Response and Sales</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s05_p01">All forms of online marketing need to drive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">traffic</a><span class="glossdef">This refers to the visitors that visit a Web site.</span></span> and sales in the long term. However, the immediacy of online advertising also drives traffic and sales in the short and medium terms. Unlike traditional media advertising, online advertising can turn the potential customer into an actual customer right there and then. What’s more, it is possible to measure accurately how effectively the online advertising campaign does this.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Key Differentiator</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s02_s06_p01">Online advertising is able to drive instant sales and conversions. Unlike offline advertising mediums, the consumer can go from advertisement to merchant in one easy click. Because of the connected nature of the Internet, online activities are highly trackable and measurable, which makes it possible to target advertisements and to accurately track and gauge the effectiveness of the advertising. Each display advertisement can be tracked for success.</p>

These were very prominent in the early days of online advertising, but audience annoyance means that there are now “pop-up blockers” built into most good Web browsers. This can be problematic as sometimes a Web site will legitimately use a pop-up to display information to the user.</p>

Definitions of acquisitions vary from site to site and may be a user filling in a form, downloading a file, or buying a product. CPA is the best way for an advertiser to pay because they only pay when the advertising has met its goal. For this reason it is also the worst type for the publisher as they are only rewarded if the advertising is successful. The publisher has to rely on the conversion rate of the advertiser’s Web site, something that the publisher cannot control. The CPA model is not commonly used for banner advertising and is generally associated with affiliate marketing.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_p02">An advertising network is a group of Web sites on which advertisements can be purchased through a single sales entity. It could be a collection of sites owned by the same publisher (e.g., AOL, CNN, and Sports Illustrated are all owned by AOL/Time Warner), or it could be an affiliation of sites that share a representative.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_p03">The advertising network acts as an intermediary between advertisers and publishers and provides a technology solution to both. As well as providing a centralized ad server that can serve advertisements to a number of Web sites, the networks offer tracking and reporting, as well as targeting.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Benefits of Ad Servers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02_p01">Rather than distribute copies of each piece of creative advertising to each publisher or media buyer, you can send out a line of code that calls up an advertisement directly from the ad server each time an advertisement is scheduled to run. The agency loads the creative to the server once and can modify rotations or add new units on the fly without needing to recontact the vendors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02_p02">The ad servers provide a wealth of data, including impressions served, advertisements clicked, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click-through rate (CTR)</a><span class="glossdef">The number and percentage of recipients who clicked on a particular uniform resource locator (URL) included in an e-mail, a Web page, and so on.</span></span>, and cost per click (CPC). Most of the ad servers also have the ability to provide performance against postclick activities such as sales, leads, downloads, or any other site-based action the advertiser may want to measure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02_p03">Ad servers provide a consistent counting methodology across the entire campaign enabling the advertiser to gain an “apples to apples” comparison of performance across the entire media schedule, which includes multiple Web sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02_p04">The ad server also allows sophisticated targeting of display advertising.</p>

An advertiser can tell not only how many times an advertisement was seen (impressions) but also how many times the advertisement was successful in sending visitors to the advertised Web site (clicks). The tracking needs to continue on the Web site to determine how successful the advertisement has been in creating more revenue for that Web site (conversions).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s05_s02_s02_p02">As well as tracking advertisements being served and clicked on, advertising networks can also provide information about the people who saw the advertisement as well as those who acted on it.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p01">Knowing the various types of display options and payment models available is helpful, but you might be wondering how to put this all together as you plan your campaign. The very first thing you need to determine when planning display advertising is the goal of your campaign. Are you embarking on a mainly branding campaign? Or is your main focus direct response?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p02">Having determined the goals of your campaign, identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will let you know how you are succeeding. KPIs are factors that indicate how successful you are in reaching your goals. Click-through rate could be a KPI for a branding campaign, while for direct response you need to focus on conversion rates. (For more on KPIs, see <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch14#fwk-105454-ch14">Chapter 15 "Web Analytics and Conversion Optimization"</a>.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p03">Online advertising is an acquisition channel. It does not require that users actively seek an interaction, as pay-per-click (PPC) advertising and e-mail marketing do. So it is crucial that the advertisements are placed in front of the audience that is most likely to convert.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p04">Investigate your target audience. What Web sites are they likely to be visiting? It is likely that the type of creative you may use and the payment model you follow will be largely determined by the Web sites on which you wish to advertise.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p05">Niche Web sites with a smaller but probably more targeted audience will most likely charge a flat rate for display advertising, or a cost per acquisition (CPA) rate. They could probably be flexible in display options that they give you, but you will need to take into account their bandwidth costs if they serve the advertisements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p06">High-traffic Web sites with a broad audience will most likely charge on a cost per mille (CPM) basis. They will broker their advertising inventory through an advertising network, or even a number of advertising networks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p07">Knowing your goals, your target audience, and the format of your advertisements, it’s time to brief your creative team to ensure that you have the optimum banners for your campaign.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p08">Your online advertisements will need to do the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_l02">
        <li>Attract attention</li>
        <li>Convey a message</li>
        <li>Entice action</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p09">Second, all advertising needs an appropriate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">landing page</a><span class="glossdef">The page a user reaches when clicking on a paid or organic search engine listing. The pages that have the most success are those that match up as closely as possible with the user’s search query.</span></span>. Whether this involves creating a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">microsite</a><span class="glossdef">Multipage ads accessed via click-throughs from initial ads. The user stays on the publisher’s Web site but has access to more information from the advertiser than a display ad allows.</span></span> or merely checking that users reach an existing page on the Web site, ensure that click-throughs are not being wasted. Generally, sending advertising traffic to your home page is not a good idea as it allows the user to decide where to go next.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p10">Animation attracts attention, but be wary of your ad being one of seven animated banners on a Web site. Banners should not be considered in isolation, but rather in the context of the Web site on which they will appear.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p11">Web users respond well to being told what to do, and the content of an online advertisement should be concise and directional. Examples include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_l03">
        <li>“Phone now for the best deals on insurance.”</li>
        <li>“Click here for fast home delivery.”</li>
        <li>“Donate now.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p12">While we have become used to the Internet as a free medium, where we can read and interact with any content we want, it is the fact that it is an advertiser’s medium that keeps the Internet free. That means that as the way we interact with content changes as technologies evolve, so advertising follows.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p13">It used to be that the level of interaction a Web user has with a Web site could be measured by the number of pages of that Web site the user viewed. Now, technology such as Ajax and rich media such as video mean that the time spent on a Web page can be more meaningful than the number of pages viewed. The key word here is “engagement,” and technology and data analysis is working toward being able to determine how Web sites can quantify the level of engagement with a viewer.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p14">VideoEgg (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.videoegg.com">http://www.videoegg.com</a>), which specializes in advertisements that appear in video clips and Facebook applications, introduced a pay-per-engagement pricing model on its advertising network in February 2008. With time spent by users on the site increasing, advertisers are able to build more interactive, more time-intensive advertisements. VideoEgg defines the engagement here as “a user-initiated rollover action that results in a sustained ad expansion. Once expanded, an ad may contain a video, game, or other rich content.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn03_003">Zachary Rodgers, “VideoEgg Offers ‘Per Engagement’ Pricing,” ClickZ, February 19, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3628492">http://www.clickz.com/showPage.html?page=3628492</a> (accessed May 1, 2008).</span> Part of VideoEgg’s offering is to optimize the placement of so-called invitation ads to guarantee the requested number of engagements among an advertiser’s target demographic.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p15">But isn’t banner advertising dead?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p16">A little research online will reveal plenty of commentary declaring the decline of display advertising. Increasingly, consumers are becoming both weary and wary of advertising. Click-through rates on banners are dropping, so some observers are questioning the effectiveness of display advertising. With the focus in eMarketing on tracking and measuring response and engagement, should a company spend money on less measurable activities such as “brand building,” where they are paying on a cost per mille (CPM) basis?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s06_p17">Consider this: Anecdotal evidence shows that banner advertising can increase click-through rates on contextual advertisements by 249 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn03_004">Seth Godin, “The 249% Solution,” Seth Godin’s Blog, October 27, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/10/the_249_solutio.html">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/10/the_249_solutio.html</a> (accessed May 1, 2008).</span> What does this tell us? Measurements should take place across all channels, and no channel should be utilized in isolation. The best results will be gained through an integrated and holistic approach to eMarketing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p01">eMarketers regularly bemoan the fact that it’s often difficult to educate the market about the value of Internet marketing techniques.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p02">Banner advertising goes a long way toward bridging the advertising divide. Online ads have a set size, they can look very similar to print ads, and they occupy a particular bit of real estate in a publication with a particular number of eyeballs looking at it. They’re easy to understand, and they do the things buyers expect advertising to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p03">Bottom line: if done correctly, online advertising builds brand awareness and increases sales!</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s02_p01">Some campaigns are better suited to having images rather than the plain text of a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign (although recently PPC image and video ads have been introduced in the United States). Consider the following methods for campaigns:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Digital shadowing</strong>. Using banner advertisements that shadow the above-the-fold activity to drive the message both on- and offline.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03_p01">Since banners can contain rich media, they offer levels of interaction that other forms of advertising cannot achieve. It allows your target market not only to see your banner but also to play with it. Interaction builds a bond and improves the chances of the consumer remembering your brand tomorrow. Cognitive learning is a powerful outcome of interactive display advertising.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03_p02">Animations, games, video, Flash—modern online advertising is able to bring together a number of other online marketing tactics:</p>

                <li>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Viral marketing</strong>. Clever viral marketing games or “send to a friend” functionality can be accessed all from within the ad.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s09_p01">BMW South Africa has been innovative in its use of online campaigns to complement its offline activities. When it came to marketing the new BMW 1 Series, BMW knew that drivers of the BMW 1 Series are generally slightly younger and at a different lifestyle age from the average BMW driver. So BMW looked at new and innovative ways as well as traditional and tested methods to reach this target market. Over July and August 2007, they ran an online campaign aimed at raising awareness of the new 1 Series BMW, generating test-drive bookings and, ultimately, driving sales leads.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s09_p02">The entire campaign was integrated, from print advertisements to the Internet, and aimed at driving people to the Web site <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://bmw.co.za/1">http://bmw.co.za/1</a>, where they were encouraged to engage with the campaign. Here, the campaign was an invitation to individuals to share their interpretation of “one” by creating a video or photo. As two different BMW 1 Series models were promoted, a two-door and a four-door, the payoff line across all channels of the campaign hinged on the difficulty to focus on “just one.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s09_p03">BMW targeted individuals utilizing a variety of different ad formats, both online and on mobile phones. These included standard banners as well as banners that expanded over competitor images.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s09_p04">The target market was reached through driving and lifestyle associations and advertisements were placed in competitive environments on driving Web sites and on corporate blogs. As well as using mobizines (branded mobile phone content), BMW partnered with Zoopy, a South African video-sharing Web site, to tap into an existing community and invite them to interact with the brand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s09_p05">The digital media campaign reached over 450,000 individuals and drove over 11 percent of the test-drive bookings concluded on the BMW Web site over the campaign period.</p>
