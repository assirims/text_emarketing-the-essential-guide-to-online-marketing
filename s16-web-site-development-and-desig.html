<span class="title-prefix">13.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_p01">Web development and design are at the heart of successful eMarketing, yet many marketers do not understand the importance of laying solid foundations here. Like building a house, solid foundations are key to stability, longevity, and even scalability. Developing a Web site involves more than choosing colors and header images.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_p02">While it is tempting to focus on the design aesthetics of Web sites, and eye-catching Web sites can be converting Web sites, it is important to remember that a Web site is a marketing tool that should be increasing revenue for the company. Web sites should be built to serve the needs of the user. A Web site is not something that users stare at—navigation usually requires action and interaction from the Web visitor. If the user’s needs are served, the Web site will be more likely to enable the company to achieve its goals.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_p03">While designers tend to talk about vision and can find conventions constraining, users of Web sites like conventions. They like Web sites that just work, without any thinking on their behalf.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_s02_p01">Usability is the number one element that needs to be considered when developing a site. Search engine visibility is the second most important factor. No one can negate the importance that search engines play in online marketing—and if their spiders cannot find a site, it is almost certain that potential customers won’t either. (Bear in mind that there are some Web sites that are designed to be found in other ways—the importance of search traffic needs to be determined before the Web site is built.) Aesthetic design is now the least important factor—but that certainly doesn’t mean that sites need to be so ugly that they turn visitors into stone. It just means that design needs to be hinged on usability and search engine visibility rather than vice versa. Web sites can still be gorgeous; they just need to fulfill other goals as well—the key here is usability and conversion-oriented design.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_s02_p02">“Design” can refer to the structural design of a Web site—which is fundamental—or to the aesthetic presentation of a Web site. We’ll use design to refer to aesthetic presentation.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s01_s02_p03">While it is critical that a site is built for optimal crawling, indexing, and ranking by search engines (its search engine visibility), the site also needs to be worthy of traffic. It needs to be built for users. It should be usable and accessible with great content and conversion-oriented design. Fortunately, optimizing a site for usability and accessibility usually enhances search engine friendliness.</p>

Following standards for important elements that are familiar to Web users means that they know immediately where to look for or how to use them.

        <li>Never resize windows or launch the site in a pop-up.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_p01">Search engine traffic is vital to a Web site; without it, chances are the site will never fulfill its marketing functions. It is essential that the search engines can see the entire publicly visible Web site, index it fully, and consider it relevant for its chosen keywords.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_p02">Here are the key considerations for search engine optimization when it comes to Web development and design.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Labeling Things Correctly</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_p01">URLs (uniform resource locators), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">alt tags</a><span class="glossdef">Textual information that is displayed if an image cannot be displayed; used by search engines to determine what an image is.</span></span>, title tags, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">metadata</a><span class="glossdef">Information that can be entered about a Web page and the elements on it that provides context and relevancy information to search engines; these used to be an important ranking factor.</span></span> all describe a Web site and its pages to both search engine spiders and people. (And don’t worry: these words are all described for you in what follows.) Chances are, clear descriptive use of these elements will appeal to both.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">URLs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p01">URLs should be as brief and descriptive as possible. This may mean that URLs require <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">server-side</a><span class="glossdef">Operations that take place on the server.</span></span> rewriting so as to cope with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dynamic parameters</a><span class="glossdef">The elements of a URL that are dynamically generated. You can identify them by question marks and ampersands in a URL.</span></span> in URLs. Does that sound a little heavy? The examples below should make this clearer.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Comparison of URLs for a Product</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_p01">The following is a comparison of the URLs for Diamante Dog Collars, an imaginary product for sale on two imaginary Web sites:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_l01">

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_p02">The first example has dynamic parameters—these are shown by the question mark and the ampersand—and uses categories that make sense to the database (e.g., pid=1201), but they make little sense to the user. Dynamic parameters are so called as they change depending on the information being requested. Next time you use a search engine to search for information, take a look at the URL and see if you can spot the dynamic parameters.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_p03">The second example is far more user friendly and clearly indicates where in the site the user is. You even start getting a good idea of the architecture of the Web site from just one URL.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_p04">More than two dynamic parameters in a URL increase the risk that the URL may not be spidered. The search engine would not even index the content on that page.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s02_s02_p05">Lastly, well-written URLs can make great anchor text. If another site is linking to yours and they use just the URL, the search engine will do a better job of knowing what the page is about if you have a descriptive URL.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s03_p02">Since search engines read text, not images, descriptive tags are the only way to tell them what the images are, but these are still essentially for users. Text readers for browsers will also read out these tags to tell the user what is there. Meaningful descriptions certainly sound a lot better than “image1,” “image2,” and “image3.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s06_p01">Meta tags are where the developer can fill in information about a Web page. These tags are not normally seen by users. If you right click on a page in a browser and select “view source,” you should see a list of entries for “<strong class="emphasis bold">&lt;meta name=</strong>.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s06_p02">These are the metadata. In the past, the meta tags were used extensively by search engine spiders, but since so many people used this to try to manipulate search results, they are now less important. Metadata now act to provide context and relevancy rather than higher rankings. However, the meta tag called “description” often appears on the search engine results page (SERP) as the snippet of text to describe the Web page being linked to. This is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s02_s05_f01">Figure 13.4</a>. If the description is accurate, well written, and relevant to the searcher’s query, these descriptions are more likely to be used by the search engine. And if it meets all those criteria, it also means the link is more likely to be clicked on by the searcher.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_p01">When it comes to Web development, the copy that is shown on the Web page needs to be kept separate from the code that tells the browser how to display the Web page. This means that the search engine spider can discern easily between what is content to be read (and hence scanned by the spider) and what are instructions to the browser. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cascading style sheet (CSS)</a><span class="glossdef">An approach to Web design that aims for lightweight code and standards-compliant Web sites.</span></span> can take care of that and is covered further in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_p02">The following text styles cannot be indexed by search engines:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Text embedded in a Java application or a Macromedia Flash file</li>
            <li>Text in an image file (that’s why you need descriptive alt tags and title attributes)</li>
            <li>Text only accessible after submitting a form, logging in, and so on</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_p03">If the search engine cannot see the text on the page, it means that it cannot spider and index that page.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_n01">

            <h2 class="title editable block">Information Architecture</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s02_p01">Well-organized information is as vital for search engines as it is for users. An effective link structure will provide benefits to search rankings and helps to ensure that a search engine indexes every page of your site.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s02_p02">Make use of a site map, linked to and from every other page in the site. The search engine spiders follow the links on a page, and this way, they will be able to index the whole site. A well-planned site map will also ensure that every page on the site is within a few clicks of the home page.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s02_p03">There are two site maps that can be used: an HTML site map that a visitor to the Web site can see, use, and make sense of and an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">XML (extensible markup language)</a><span class="glossdef">A standard used for creating structured documents.</span></span> site map that contains additional information for the search engine spiders. An XML site map can be submitted to search engines to promote full and regular indexing. Again, a dynamically generated site map will update automatically when content is added.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s02_p04">Using a category structure that flows from broad to narrow also indicates to search engines that your site is highly relevant and covers a topic in depth.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Canonical Issues: There Can Be Only One</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s03_p01">Have you noticed that sometimes several URLs can all give you the same Web page? For example, refer to the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>http://www.websitename.com</li>
                <li>http://websitename.com</li>
                <li>http://www.websitename.com/index.html</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s03_p02">All the above can be used for the same home page of a Web site. However, search engines see these as three separate pages with duplicate content. Search engines look for unique documents and content, and when duplicates are encountered, a search engine will select one as canonical, and display that page in the SERPs (search engine results pages). However, it will also dish out a lower rank to that page and all its copies. Any value is diluted by having multiple versions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s03_p03">Lazy Webmasters sometimes forget to put any kind of redirect in place, meaning that http:// websitename.com doesn’t exist, while http://www.websitename.com does. This is termed “Lame-Ass Syndrome” (LAS) by Quirk, a fitting moniker.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s03_p04">Having multiple pages with the same content, however that came about, hurts the Web site’s search engine rankings. There is a solution: 301 redirects can be used to point all versions to a single, canonical version.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Robots.txt</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p01">A robots.txt file restricts a search engine spider from crawling and indexing certain pages of a Web site by giving instructions to the search engine spider, or bot. This is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Robots Exclusion Protocol</a><span class="glossdef">A protocol used to indicate to search engine robots which pages should not be indexed.</span></span>. So, if there are pages or directories on a Web site that should not appear in the SERPs, the robots.txt file should be used to indicate this to search engines.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p02">If a search engine robot wants to crawl a Web site URL—for example, http://www.websitename.com/welcome.html—it will first check for http://www.web sitename.com/robots.txt.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p03">Visiting the second URL will show a text file with the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_l01">
                <li>User-agent: *</li>
                <li>Disallow: /</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p04">Here, “User-agent: *” means that the instruction is for all bots. If the instruction is to specific bots, it should be identified here. The “Disallow: /” is an instruction that no pages of the Web site should be indexed. If there are only certain pages or directories that should not be indexed, they should be included here.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p05">For example, if there is both an HTML and a PDF (portable document format) version of the same content, the wise Webmaster will instruct search engine bots to index only one of the two to avoid being penalized for duplicate content.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p06">The robots.txt file is publicly accessible, so although it does not show restricted content, it can give an idea of the content that a Web site owner wants to keep private. A robots.txt file needs to be created for each subdomain.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s03_s03_s04_p07">Here is a robots.txt file with additional information.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_p03">Every Web site needs to be designed with clear goals (or conversions) in mind. Conversions take many forms and may include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_l02">

        <h2 class="title editable block">Design to Establish Credibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_p01">Here are some of the cues that visitors use to determine the credibility of a Web site:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Place phone numbers and addresses</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">above the fold</a><span class="glossdef">All the content that can be seen on a screen without scrolling down.</span></span>. This assures the visitor that there is a real person behind the Web site and that he or she is in easy reach.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create an informative and personal “about us</strong>.” Your customers want to see the inner workings of a company and are especially interested in learning more about the head honchos. Include employee pictures or profiles. It puts a face to an organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feature genuine testimonials on each page</strong>. This is a great way to show potential customers what your current customers have to say about your organization. Trust is vital, and this is one way to encourage it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feature logos of associations and awards</strong>. If you belong to any relevant industry associations or have won any awards, feature them. Not only does this go a long way to establish your credibility, but it will show that you’re at the top of your game and a notch above the competition.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Link to credible third-party references</strong>. This is a way to assert your credibility without tooting your own horn.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep content fresh and updated</strong>. This shows that you are knowledgeable and up to date in your industry.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ensure that your site is free of errors</strong>. Spelling and grammar mistakes are exceptionally unprofessional, and while the large majority of readers may not pick up on them, the one or two who do will question your credibility.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Include a portfolio of past work</strong>. Give your Web site visitors examples of your previous work to show what you are capable of.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_p02">Design also affects the accessibility of a Web site. You need to take into account screen resolutions, as designing for the biggest screen available could leave many of your users scrolling across and down to see the Web page. Subtle shading, background colors to text, and fancy fonts can also mean that many users cannot even see your Web site properly.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p01">A cascading style sheet (CSS) is defined by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) as “a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn12_002">“Cascading Style Sheets Home Page,” World Wide Web Consortium, June 3, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/css">http://www.w3c.org/Style/css</a> (accessed June 23, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p02">In the early days of the Web, designers tended to use tables to lay out content for a Web page, and many Web sites still do so today. However, different browsers, and even different versions of browsers, all support code differently, resulting in Web sites that only work on certain browsers or bulky code needed to cope with all the different versions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p03">The W3C (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>) was created in 1994 and since then has been responsible for specifications and guidelines to promote the evolution of the Web, while ensuring that Web technologies work well together. The Web Standards Project (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webstandards.org">http://www.webstandards.org</a>) launched in 1998 and labeled key guidelines as “Web standards.” Modern browsers should be built to support these standards, which should vastly reduce cross-browser compatibility problems, such as Web sites displaying differently in different browsers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p04">Web standards include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>HTML (hypertext markup language)</li>
            <li>CSS (cascading style sheet)</li>
            <li>XML (extensible markup language)</li>
            <li>XHTML (extensible hypertext markup language)</li>
            <li>DOM (document object model)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p05">CSS is standard layout language. It controls colors, typography, and the size and placement of elements on a Web page. Previously, Web developers have had to create instructions for every page in a Web site. With CSS, a single file can control the appearance of an entire site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p06">CSS allows designers and developers to separate presentation from content. This has several key benefits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_l02">
            <li>Sites are easier to maintain and update and are more accessible.</li>
            <li>Content may be updated easily by someone who is not a Web designer or developer.</li>
            <li>Global changes can be applied quickly and easily.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Content Management System</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p01">As the name implies, a content management system (CMS) is used to manage the content of a Web site. If a site is updated frequently and if people other than Web developers need to update the content of a Web site, a CMS is used. Today, many sites are built on a CMS. The CMS can also allow content of a Web site to be updated from any location in the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p02">A CMS can be built specifically for a Web site, and many Web development companies build their own CMS that can be used by their clients. A CMS can also be bought prebuilt, and there are many <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open-source</a><span class="glossdef">Unlike proprietary software, open-source software makes the source code available so that other developers can build applications for or even improve the software.</span></span>, prebuilt CMSs available, some of which are free.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p03">A CMS should be selected with the goals and functions of the Web site in mind. A CMS needs to be able to scale along with the Web site and business that it supports, and not the other way around.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Of course, the CMS selected should result in a Web site that is search engine friendly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p05">Here are some key features to look out for when selecting or building a CMS:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meta and title tag customization</strong>. The CMS should allow you to enter your own meta tags and fully customize title tags for each page.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">HTML tag customization</strong>. The CMS should allow for full customization of HTML tags, such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nofollow links</a><span class="glossdef">Nofollow is an attribute of a hyperlink, indicating to search engines that the link is not endorsed by the Web site.</span></span>. See <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch06#fwk-105454-ch06">Chapter 6 "Search Engine Optimization"</a> for an explanation of nofollow links.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">URLs</strong>. Instead of using dynamic parameters, the CMS should allow for server-side rewriting of URLs (uniform resource locators). It should allow for the creation of URLs that have the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_l02">
                    <li>Static</li>
                    <li>Rewritable</li>
                    <li>Keyword rich</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customizable navigation</strong>. A good CMS will allow flexibility when it comes to creating the information architecture for a Web site. For the purposes of adding additional content for search engines, a CMS should not require that all content pages be linked to from the home page navigation. This allows content to be added for SEO (search engine optimization) purposes, without adding it to the main navigation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">301 redirect functionality</strong>. It is imperative that a CMS offers the ability to put in place 301 redirects to prevent penalization for duplicate content on different URLs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customizable image naming and alt tags for images</strong>. A good CMS will allow you to create custom alt tags and title attributes for images.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Robots.txt management</strong>. Ensure you are able to customize the robots.txt to your needs, or that this can at least be managed using meta tags.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Content search</strong>. Make sure you are able to include a useful site search.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p06">Be aware when building clean, descriptive, and dynamic URLs from CMS content. Should you use a news heading (“Storm” in this example) as part of your URL (http://www.websitename.com/cape/storm) and someone changes the heading to “Tornado” (http://www.websitename.com/cape/tornado), this will alter the URL and the search engines will index this as a new page, but with the same content as the URL that had the old heading. Bear this in mind before adding dynamic parameters to your URLs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p07">Finally, using a CMS that supports standards compliant HTML and CSS is very important—without it inconsistencies may be rendered across various browsers. It also ensures faster loading time and reduced bandwidth, makes markup easier to maintain, supports SEO efforts, and ensures that every single visitor to a Web site, no matter what browser they are using, will be able to see everything on the site.</p>

Client-side validation can alert a visitor to an incorrectly filled-in form most quickly, but server-side validation is the most accurate. It is also important to have a tool to collect all the failed tests and present appropriate error messages neatly above the form the user is trying to complete. This will ensure that correctly entered data are not lost but repopulated in the form to save time and reduce frustration.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s05_s07_p03">Search engine spiders do not support cookies, so many Web sites will attempt URL rewriting to maintain the session as the spider crawls the Web site. However, these URLs are not liked by search engine spiders (as they appear to create a moving target for the robot) and can hinder crawling and indexing. The work-around: use technology to detect if a visitor to the site is a person or a robot, and do not rewrite URLs for the search engine robots.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s06_p04">On the product pages, all product images were increased in size, and more images were included so that Web users could see the product from a variety of angles. Gifts for boys and gifts for girls were color coded to ensure easy navigation. The help line was prominently displayed on each page, as was an easy add-to-cart button. Pertinent information showing whether the item was in stock and how long it would take to ship was also easily available.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s06_p05">A birthday-reminder tool was implemented on the Web site. When users register with Wicked Uncle and register a child’s age, they get yearly birthday reminders of the child’s birthday. This has been very successful and has built up a database of e-mail addresses—from zero to fifteen thousand in less than a year!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s06_p06">The shopping process is exceptionally smooth, with functionality being carefully thought out. Within the process, the user is able to register different children with their own delivery address. The colors used in the shopping cart complement the Web site but are unique to the cart, so the cart stands out. There is always a clear indication of what the next step in the check-out process is.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s06_p07">Lastly, for those shoppers in a hurry, the Web site features a 1-Minute Gift Finder. With a new Web site that is easy to use, Wicked Uncle was able to run campaigns to drive targeted traffic to the Web site.</p>
