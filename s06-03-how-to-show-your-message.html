        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s03_s02_p01">There are many different ways to display messages online, and as technology develops, so does online advertising. Here are some of the most common.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s03_s02_s03_p01">As the name suggests, these are advertisements that pop up, or under, the Web page being viewed. They open in a new, smaller window. You will see a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pop-up</a><span class="glossdef">Unrequested window that opens on top of the currently viewed window.</span></span> right away but will probably only become aware of a pop-under after you close your browser window. These were very prominent in the early days of online advertising, but audience annoyance means that there are now “pop-up blockers” built into most good Web browsers. This can be problematic as sometimes a Web site will legitimately use a pop-up to display information to the user.</p>
