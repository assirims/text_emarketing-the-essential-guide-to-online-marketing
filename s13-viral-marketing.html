<span class="title-prefix">10.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_p01">Word-of-mouth marketing is powerful. Edelman’s 2010 Trust Barometer shows that 44 percent of respondents trust “a person like me” as a spokesperson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn09_001">“Edelman Trust Barometer 2010,” Edelman, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.edelman.co.uk/trustbarometer/files/edelman-trust-barometer-2010.pdf">http://www.edelman.co.uk/trustbarometer/files/edelman-trust-barometer-2010.pdf</a> (accessed May 10, 2010).</span> In <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch08#fwk-105454-ch08">Chapter 8 "Social Media"</a>, you learned some of the ways that marketers can tap into the media that promote this kind of trust. Messages passed on from “a person like me” is word-of-mouth marketing, and online that same message can be passed on through social media.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_p02">Viral marketing is a form of word-of-mouth marketing that aims to result in a message spreading exponentially. It takes its name from a virus because of the similarities that marketers aim to emulate:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_l01">
        <li>It is easily passed on.</li>
        <li>The number of people who have been “infected” grows exponentially.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p01">The term “viral marketing” was probably first coined by Jeffrey Rayport in an article “The Virus of Marketing” in the December 1996 issue of <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn09_002">Jeffrey Rayport, “The Virus of Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 31, 1996, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/virus.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/virus.html</a> (accessed May 10, 2008).</span> That’s not to say that there weren’t viral marketing campaigns before that, but as the Internet developed, so have the electronic tools for passing on information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p02">Word of mouth has existed as long as there have been words and mouths, but it is a fairly recent phenomenon in the world of marketing. Positive word of mouth can have a tremendous impact on a brand and can take up little to nothing of the marketing department’s budget. However, planning for and measuring word of mouth can be tricky and unpredictable.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s01_s02_p03">As the connected nature of the Internet has allowed for easier spreading and tracking of word-of-mouth information, it has become possible to see how this can be modeled on the spread of a virus in a population.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_p01">Viral growth occurs when a message is spread exponentially. Viral marketing campaigns work when a message is spread exponentially and it results in a desired outcome for a brand. Viral marketing utilizes electronic means to spread messages. It harnesses the electronic connectivity of individuals to ensure marketing messages are referred from one person to another.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_p02">Viral marketing campaigns can be tricky and unpredictable. However, the lure of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exponential growth</a><span class="glossdef">If growth more than doubles with each iteration, it is exponential.</span></span>, at a very low marginal cost, means that they are being attempted more often.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">MSN Hotmail: From Zero to Thirty Million</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_p03">MSN Hotmail, the Web e-mail service purchased by Microsoft, grew to thirty million members in just two and a half years from its launch in July 1996. A large part of its exponential growth is attributed to the sign-up link that was in the footer of every e-mail sent with the service. When the company launched, every outgoing message from this platform contained an advertisement for Hotmail and a link to its Web site at the bottom of the e-mail. As people e-mailed their friends and colleagues, they were also advertising the service. Recipients could simply click on the link and sign themselves up, and as they continued to e-mail friends from their new account, the message spread within existing social networks and was passed along with little effort from the company. Hotmail went from zero to thirty million users within the first three years, and today has over five hundred million users worldwide.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_p04">There are two types of viral marketing campaigns:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_l02">
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organic (or in-the-wild) campaigns</a><span class="glossdef">Campaigns that have been strategically planned, have defined goals for the brand being marketed, and usually have a distinct method of passing on the message.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Amplified (or controlled) campaigns</a><span class="glossdef">Campaigns that grow with little or no input from the marketer.</span></span></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Organic Viral Marketing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Organic (or in-the-wild) viral campaigns grow with little or no input from the marketer. Sometimes, a message is passed around in a viral nature without any intention from the marketer. Usually this happens with negative messages about a brand, but it can also be a happy coincidence for a brand if the message is positive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02_p02">Organic <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">word of mouth</a><span class="glossdef">Information that is passed between people, as opposed to messages from a company to people.</span></span> is credited with the sudden increase in the popularity of Hush Puppies shoes in the mid-1990s. Word of mouth increased sales from an all time low of 30,000 in 1994, to 430,000 in 1995, and to four times that the following year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02_p03">This is an example of an organic viral campaign:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>It was not planned (though it was very welcomed) by Hush Puppies.</li>
            <li>Participants made an active choice to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pass on</a><span class="glossdef">To share content with another person.</span></span> the message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s02_p04">When successful, this type of campaign can build tremendous brand equity at a marginal cost. Because the communication takes place directly between consumers, the marketer has to be prepared to let go of their brand so that the message and flow of communication is not restricted. This is vital to ensuring the viral campaign is a success, as people are more likely to try a new product or fulfill the campaign goal if their friend or a trusted source referred them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Amplified Viral Marketing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p01">Amplified (or controlled) campaigns have been strategically planned, have defined goals for the brand being marketed, and usually have a distinct method of passing on the message (that can be tracked and quantified by the marketer). The Hotmail example above is a controlled campaign:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>The goal was to grow membership.</li>
            <li>The e-mails being sent were automatically passing on the message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p02">A viral campaign can be an important part of an eMarketing strategy. Viral marketing campaigns contribute in a number of ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_l02">
            <li>With correct planning, a viral campaign can provide plenty of link love for your search engine optimization (SEO) strategy. Campaigns should be built with that in mind. While there might be a microsite created for the viral campaign, ensure that it is easy to link to the main Web site.</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to measure <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand awareness</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of how quickly a brand is called to mind.</span></span>, but this is usually the chief aim of any viral campaign. Bear that in mind, and make sure that the campaign is targeting the right demographic and that branding is clear without detracting from the social nature of a viral campaign.</li>
            <li>Viral campaigns can also drive direct response, from newsletter sign-ups, to collaboration on consumer-generated media (CGM), to purchases that can be directly correlated to the campaign.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Stormhoek and Threshers: A Voucher Frenzy</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p03">Threshers is an off-license chain in the United Kingdom. Stormhoek, a South African winery, is one of the brands that they sell. In November 2006, Threshers put a voucher on its Web site offering 40 percent off all wines and champagnes between November 30 and December 10. Stormhoek, which had a large following online through its blog at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stormhoek.com">http://www.stormhoek.com</a>, asked if it could pass on the offer to its audience. Threshers’ response: “Of course, it’s just a blog.” Stormhoek posted the voucher to its blog on Friday, November 24. Hugh MacLeod, a partner in the winery who was also working with Stormhoek on its online strategy, also posted the voucher to his popular blog, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gapingvoid.com">http://www.gapingvoid.com</a>.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p04">On Monday, November 27 there were 37,000 downloads of the voucher; Tuesday saw 56,000 downloads; and on Friday, December 1, the day the promotion started, the voucher was downloaded 715,000 times.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p05">By December 5, the voucher had been downloaded 3.5 million times. BBC News reported on December 1 that “queues have formed at one store while the Threshers Web site has crashed under the strain of demand for the offer.” And within the first five days of the offer, Threshers reported a 60 percent increase in weekend sales, with many stores selling one week’s worth of wine in a single day, queues out the door, and stocks depleted by 80 percent in some shops.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p06">The Threshers Web site (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.threshergroup.com">http://www.threshergroup.com</a>) saw 30,000 downloads of the voucher, about 1 percent of the total downloads. Stormhoek found that being at the center of a viral marketing phenomenon saw branding and sales increase. In addition to television and print press mentions, Stormhoek saw sales of its wines increase at other stores, not just at Threshers. There was no promotion or discount at the other stores.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s02_s03_p07">Stormhoek has won awards for its innovative use of social media to disrupt the wine market and increase wine sales, and Christmas 2006 saw that happen once again.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_p01">Viral campaigns are unpredictable. As the market becomes saturated with more campaigns competing for attention, it is increasingly difficult for marketers to ensure a hit. However, careful planning means that you are ready when your campaign takes off. Careful planning also means that you have given the campaign the best chance of success.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Define the Aims of the Campaign and How You Will Measure Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s02_p01">A video created by your department and watched by millions of people on the Internet is certainly an attractive proposition, but if it does nothing to contribute to your business goals, it is a fun but pointless exercise. Can this medium reach your target market?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s02_p02">Determine if your campaign will be aimed at building brand awareness, driving traffic to your Web site, growing anticipation for a new product, building lots of SEO links, or making sure customers make a purchase right away. Viral campaigns should always build you links, whether or not that is a main aim of the campaign. Because of this, you should try to influence the anchor text—or the visible, clickable text in a link—being used.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Plan a Message or Content That Users Want to Share</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03_p01">On the Internet, there is a lot going on. For a campaign to be worthy of sending on, it has to stand out from the clutter. You need to be original by doing some of the following things:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Make something scarce</li>

            <li>Be very funny</li>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03_p02">A mashup is when content from two or more sources is combined. Search for “mashup” on YouTube to watch some examples.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03_p03">Burger King created the Web site “Subservient Chicken” (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.subservientchicken.com">http://www.subservientchicken.com</a>), where anyone could tell a man dressed up in a chicken suit what to do. It is very funny and quite bizarre. It got a lot of traffic. Hotmail made their e-mail service available to anyone. When Gmail was launched, it was by invitation only, and Google ensured that the invites were scarce. People talked about both services quite a bit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s03_p04">Using controversial or enticing names for viral content makes it more likely that your audience will want to investigate further.

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Make Your Content Easy to Share</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s04_p01">The easier a message is to pass on, the more likely it will be passed on. E-mails should include “forward to a friend” links, and a “send to a friend” link can be added easily to any Web page.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s04_p02">Viral marketers can make use of existing social media both as an environment in which to host their message and as a means to share their message. For example, using a popular video-hosting site, such as YouTube, for a viral video makes it easy for users to embed the video onto their own sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s04_p03">For best response, personalize e-mails automated by the sharing process (with subject lines like “Your friend Mark Hunter thought you’d find this amusing”). And for best SEO practice, tell users how to link to your content.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Make It as Simple as Possible for Users to Get Involved</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s05_p01">For campaigns that require interaction, it should be as easy as possible for users to sign up and get interacting. Lengthy sign-up forms asking for lots of information will slow and can even halt your campaign.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 5: Be Authentic and Transparent</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s06_p01">It’s a viral marketing campaign for a brand, and marketers who pretend otherwise can see the attempt blowing up in their faces. Studies have shown that branding does not have a significant detrimental effect to the contagious nature of a viral campaign.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 6: Provide an Incentive for Sharing and Interacting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s07_p01">The greatest incentive for users sharing your content is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social currency</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of a person’s power and influence within a defined social group.</span></span>: something that users will want to share. People like to be seen by their friends and colleagues as resourceful, caring, or humorous, and the content you create should tie in with those values. Tailoring your content for your target market will give you even better results.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s07_p02">Incentives can be financial: a gift voucher for every five friends the campaign is sent to. Or users could be entered into a competition for every ten friends they refer. However, campaigns work best when the prize does not eclipse the content. Increasing social currency works for a brand, too; it will increase brand equity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s08_p02">With any successful campaign, the spread of the message can usually be traced to several core influencers: those people responsible for the viral growth. Influencers tend to affect a large number of people either by sending the message to lots of people or by causing lots of people to want to emulate them. However, influencers are difficult to identify prior to success, and so seeding a campaign should attract as large an audience as possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s08_p03">Be aware, as well, that editorial mentions in traditional media can also create a huge amount of traffic for a campaign, so press releases still need to be part of the seeding process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s03_s08_p04">Using forums and inciting blog comments can all help get content out there.</p>
