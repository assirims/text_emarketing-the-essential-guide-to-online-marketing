While the basic process remains the same for each one, there are some differences.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_p02">With PPC advertising, the advertiser does the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_l02">
        <li>Creates the content for an advertisement</li>

        <li>Chooses the maximum amount they are willing to pay for a click on the advertisement (this amount can be unique to each keyword they have selected for an advertisement)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_p03">The search engine algorithm does the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_l03">
        <li>Checks the advertisement for compliance to editorial guidelines</li>
        <li>Displays the advertisement for relevant search queries</li>
        <li>Determines the rank, or position, of the advertisement based on the advertiser’s maximum bid and the relevance of the advertisement (which includes factors such as click-through rate [CTR], ad copy, keywords, and landing-page relevance to the search)</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Advertisers can choose to have their advertisements displayed on the search network only (which means on search engines), or they can select to have the advertisements displayed on the content network.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s02_p02">The search network will include the search engine that owns the platform (so Google for AdWords), as well as other search engines for which that platform provides paid results (e.g., currently Ask.com uses the AdWords platform for paid results).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s02_p03">The content network refers to Web sites other than search engines that also display PPC advertisements. For Google AdWords, these are the Web sites and blogs that have joined Google AdSense, Google’s publishers’ platform. Google determines the content of the Web site and then displays appropriate PPC advertisements. Typically, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">CPC (cost per click)</a><span class="glossdef">Paid when a link is clicked upon.</span></span> for text ads is lower than on the search network, but the CTR and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversion rate</a><span class="glossdef">Percentage of actions divided by click.</span></span> can be much lower. The Google content network also allows image, video, and mobile ads.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p01">Text PPC advertisements follow the same basic structure:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p02">Heading</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p03">Two lines of advertisement copy,</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p04">Which can be displayed on one line</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p05">www.DisplayURL.com</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p06">The URL (uniform resource locator) shown is not necessarily the URL that the user will click through to. When writing the copy, these are known as the display URL (what is shown on the advertisement) and the destination URL (what the actual URL of the page is). The display URL is sometimes also called a vanity URL. The aim should be to send users to a Web page as specific to their search, and the PPC advertisement, as possible. This is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deep linking</a><span class="glossdef">Making a hyperlink that points to a specific page or image on another Web site instead of that Web site’s main or home page.</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s02_s03_p08">The display URL must be the same domain as the destination URL. Google will only show one advertisement per display URL. So an advertisement might look like this:</p>
