    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p01">As we mentioned, PPC (pay per click) does not only apply to search engine advertising. We have seen that advertisements can be placed on content sites. PPC can also refer to display advertising, where advertisers pay only for each click-through to their site, as opposed to each impression of the banner. PPC is also used by many online comparison engines.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p02">You have probably come across online comparison engines when searching for a particular product. Popular comparison engines include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>NexTag (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nextag.com">http://www.nextag.com</a>)</li>
        <li>PriceRunner (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pricerunner.com">http://www.pricerunner.com</a>)</li>
        <li>Kelkoo (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kelkoo.co.uk">http://www.kelkoo.co.uk</a>)</li>
        <li>Pangora (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pangora.com">http://www.pangora.com</a>)</li>
        <li>Jump (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jump.co.za">http://www.jump.co.za</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p03">These engines contract with retailers. The retailers supply the engine with a product feed (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">XML [extensible markup language]</a><span class="glossdef">A standard used for creating structured documents. XML promises more efficient and organized delivery of data over the Internet.

    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_l03">
        <li>Product name</li>
        <li>Product price</li>

        <p class="para">A shopping comparison engine will show offers from a number of retailers.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p04">When a user searches for a product on one of the comparison engines, the engine will list all retailers who offer that product. When the engines contract the retailers, they also agree on how much the retailer is willing to pay for each click from the comparison engine through to the retailer’s Web site. The minimum CPC (cost per click) will vary from category to category (consumer electronics, for example, could have a higher CPC than baby clothes).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p05">When results are shown, priority is given to those retailers who are willing to pay a higher CPC. However, the user has the option of sorting results by price, alphabetically, and so on.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p06">Online comparison engines form an important part of the online marketing mix for an online retailer. As well as comparing products from different retailers, they also offer users the chance to review products as well as retailers. Many users prefer to start their product search on a comparison engine, as they can see a variety of prices for the same product in one place.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_p07">So what can you do to market your site more effectively through online comparison engines? You may try any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_l04">
        <li>Measure conversion from the clicks you get from the comparison engine. You’re paying for the traffic; make sure it’s worthwhile.</li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Optimize the product feed you supply:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_l05">
                <li>It should be up to date.</li>
                <li>Product names should be clear.</li>
                <li>Each product must have a unique URL.</li>
                <li>The product should have a succinct description.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Make sure your price is right:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_l06">
                <li>Don’t overpay for clicks.</li>
                <li>Ensure your pricing and customer service are competitive: you don’t have much space to entice the user to click through to your site.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch07_s05_s02_p01">The foundation of search marketing is keyword research, and there are a number of tools that will both aid you in growing your keyword list and in determining keyword volumes. Some are free and some require a fee. Many keyword volume tools have relied on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Overture</a><span class="glossdef">Formerly GoTo.com, bought by Yahoo! and provider of Yahoo!’s PPC (pay-per-click) advertising.

All these tools should be used as guidelines only. Test the data with your own campaigns to determine what works best for you.</p>
