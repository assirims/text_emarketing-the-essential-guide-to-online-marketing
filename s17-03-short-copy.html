    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_p01">Online copy often has only a limited amount of space and short amount of time to get a message across to visitors and entice them to take action. This is especially true of banner advertising and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">PPC</a><span class="glossdef">Advertising on search engines.</span></span> (pay-per-click) advertisements on search engines, but it is also is important across all eMarketing disciplines.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p01">A crucial element to online copywriting is the CTA. Users scan Web pages and look for clues as to what to do. Don’t make them think; tell them what action to perform.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p02">A call to action is a short, descriptive instruction that explicitly tells a Web visitor what to do. Banner advertising usually involves a clear call to action, and it can also be used in paid search advertising. Call-to-action copy is not limited to short copy: e-mail newsletters and promotions should also make use of call to action, and we even see them all over Web pages. Calls to action should always be above the fold to drive action.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p04">Any time that there is an action that you want a Web visitor to take, a call to action should instruct the visitor what to do. This means using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active verbs</a><span class="glossdef">In a call to action, it is the word that conveys action or behavior.</span></span> when you write and crafting hyperlinks to be clear instructions that resonate with your visitor at each step in the conversion process.</p>

                <li>Join our database and win great prizes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p05">A strong call to action resonates with the action that the visitor needs to take, as opposed to the technical function that is performed. For example, if a user has entered an e-mail address to sign up to your e-mail newsletter, the action button should say “sign up” (which is what a user understands) and not “submit” (which is the database action).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p06">Consider what actions mean offline:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_l03">
            <li>With e-mail newsletters, “sign up” can have very different connotations from “subscribe.”</li>
            <li>“Subscribe” is very different from “subscribe for free.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_p07">Whereas subscriptions connote regularity as to the times when newsletters are sent (e.g., once a week, on a particular day at a particular time), “sign up” does not carry the same burden. There is only one way to know what call to action works best on a Web page, in an e-mail, on a banner, or in an advertisement: test, test, test. You could do this by performing A/B split tests to see which CTA drives the most clicks or actions.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Features and Benefits</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p01">Writing compelling copy means conveying to readers why they should perform an action. While <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">features</a><span class="glossdef">A prominent aspect of a product that is beneficial to users.</span></span> may seem all-important, you need to communicate the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">benefits</a><span class="glossdef">The positive outcome for a user that a feature provides.</span></span> of the features to the user, as this is the ultimate driver of action. Features and benefits are described as follows:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feature</strong>. A prominent aspect of a product or service that can provide benefit to users. It describes what the product does.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Benefit</strong>. The positive outcome for a user that a feature provides. It can be the emotional component of what the user gets out of the product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p02">Features and benefits are very different. Features are what are important to the company that provides the product or service. Benefits are what are important to those who decide to use the product or service. This part of the copy could be the make-or-break selling point, so be direct and illustrate why they should choose your product instead of your competitor’s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p03">For example, consider a home entertainment system. Features could include surround sound and a large flat-screen television. The benefit is a cinema-quality experience in your own home.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p04">Persuasive writing makes use of features, benefits, and active verbs to create appealing messages for your personas: <em class="emphasis">Enjoy cinema-quality movie nights in your own home with a surround sound home entertainment system</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s02_s02_p05">Be personal, be descriptive, and illustrate that their needs will be met and even surpassed.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">PPC Advertisements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_p01">PPC advertisements have a very limited space, and very limited time, to get a message across, as well as plenty of competition for an Internet user’s attention. These four lines of copy need to work hard to be convincing and compelling to ensure a top return on investment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_p02">PPC advertisements follow the same basic structure:</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Heading</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p01">A heading in PPC advertising looks like the following:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para"> </p>
                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p02">Two lines of advertisement copy,</p>
                <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p03">Which can be displayed on one line</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p05">Refer to <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch07#fwk-105454-ch07">Chapter 7 "Pay per Click Advertising"</a> for Google’s editorial guidelines.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p06">When the copy of the advertisement matches the user’s search term, those words are often displayed in bold in the advertisement. This makes the advertisement more prominent and can improve click-through rates. This is also why keyword research is very important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p07">For example, if the search term used was “roses,” an advertisement with “roses” in the copy might look like this:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_bl02">
                <p class="para"> </p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p12">Using keywords in the advertisement copy can help improve click-through rates. However, this can mean writing thousands of advertisements—one for each keyword in the PPC campaign! The paid search advertising platforms have a neat tool to bypass this problem: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dynamic keyword insertion</a><span class="glossdef">In paid search advertising, this allows keywords used in searches to be inserted automatically into advertisement copy.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p13">Dynamic keyword insertion allows for the search term used to be inserted into the advertisement copy. This means that you can write one advertisement, and every time it appears for a different search term, that search term will be inserted into the advertisement. In the copy for the advertisement, it looks like this:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p14">{keyword:alternative word}</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p15">The brackets indicate that this is where the dynamic keyword should go. The copywriter also needs to select an alternative keyword to show if the search term used does not fit into the space available.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s03_s03_s02_p16">Google’s tutorial on dynamic keyword insertion has the following examples that explain this best.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn13_003">Google, “How Do I Use Keyword Insertion?” tutorial, Google AdWords Help Center, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;query=dki&amp;answer=74996&amp;type=f">http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;query=dki&amp;answer=74996&amp;type=f</a> (accessed June 17, 2008).</span></p>
