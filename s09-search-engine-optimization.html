<span class="title-prefix">6.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_p01">With millions of people performing millions of searches each day to find content on the Internet, it makes sense that marketers want their products to be found by potential consumers. Search engines use closely guarded algorithms to determine the results that are displayed. However, determining what factors these algorithms take into account has led to a growing practice known as search engine optimization.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_p02">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of optimizing a Web site so as to achieve preferred ranking on the search engine results pages (SERPs). Someone who practices SEO professionally is also known as an SEO (search engine optimizer).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_p03">SEO can be split into two distinct camps: white-hat SEO and black-hat SEO (with some grey-hat wearers in between). Black-hat SEO refers to trying to game the search engines. These SEOs use dubious means to achieve high rankings, and their Web sites are occasionally blacklisted by the search engines. White-hat SEO, on the other hand, refers to working within the parameters set by search engines to optimize a Web site for better user experience. Search engines want to send users to the Web site that is most suited to their needs, so white-hat SEO should ensure that users can find what they are looking for.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">History</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p01">By the mid-1990s, Webmasters had begun to optimize their sites for search engines due to a growing awareness of the importance of being listed by the various engines. Initially, all a Webmaster needed to do was submit the URL (uniform resource locator) of a Web page for it to be indexed. Search engines relied on the metadata, information that Webmasters inserted in the code of a Web page, to determine what a Web page was about and to index it appropriately.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Industry analyst Danny Sullivan records that the earliest known use of the term “search engine optimization” was a spam message posted on Usenet, an online forum or message board, on July 26, 1997.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn06_001">Danny Sullivan, “Who Invented the Term ‘Search Engine Optimization’?” Search Engine Watch, June 14, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showpost.php?p=2119&amp;postcount=10">http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/showpost.php?p=2119&amp;postcount=10</a> (accessed June 6, 2008).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p03">Realizing the importance of being ranked highly in search results, Webmasters began using the search engine’s reliance on metadata to manipulate the ranking for their Web sites. To combat this, search engines in turn have developed more complex algorithms including a number of other ranking factors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p04">While at Stanford University, Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed a search engine, called Backrub, that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rank Web pages. This was the precursor to Google. They founded Google in 1998, which relied on PageRank and hyperlink analysis as well as on-page factors to determine the prominence of a Web page. This enabled Google to avoid the same kind of manipulation of on-page factors to determine ranking.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p05">PageRank relies on the uniquely democratic nature of the web by using its vast link structure as an indicator of an individual page’s value. In essence, Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B. But Google looks at more than the sheer volume of votes, or links a page receives; it also analyzes the page that casts the vote. Votes cast by pages that are themselves “important” weigh more heavily and help to make other pages “important.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn06_002">“Understanding Google Page Rank,” Accu Web Hosting, May 20, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.accuwebhosting.com/Articles/Understanding_Google_Page_Rank.html">http://www.accuwebhosting.com/Articles/Understanding_Google_Page_Rank.html</a> (accessed June 18, 2010).</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p06">PageRank was based on the practice of academic citations. The more times an academic paper is cited, the more likely it is an authority paper on the subject. Page and Brin used a similar theory for their search engine—the more times a Web page or Web site is linked to, the more likely it is that the community considers that page an authority. It should be noted that the importance of page rank has been greatly reduced over the years.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s01_s02_p07">Ranking highly in search results is vital to Web sites, so Webmasters have adapted as search engines have updated their algorithms to avoid being “gamed.” Today, Google says it uses more than two hundred different factors in its algorithm (which changes over four hundred times yearly) to determine relevance and ranking. None of the major search engines disclose the elements they use to rank pages, but there are many SEO practitioners who spend time analyzing patent applications to try to determine what these are.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p01">Search engines need to help users find what they’re looking for. To make sure they list the best results first, they look for signals of the following:</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p02">Search engine optimization (SEO), also called organic or natural optimization, involves optimizing Web sites to achieve high rankings on the search engines for certain selected key phrases.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p03">This is achieved by making changes to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypertext markup language (HTML)</a><span class="glossdef">The “language” read by Web browsers. Certain HTML “tags” are used to structure the information and features within a Web page. As an example, HTML e-mails usually contain graphics and can be interactive.</span></span> code, content, and structure of a Web site, making it more accessible for search engines, and by extension, easier to find by users. These are also known as on-page factors. SEO also involves off-page factors—these generally build <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">links</a><span class="glossdef">A link is a URL (uniform resource locator) imbedded on a Web page. If you click on the link you will be taken to that page.</span></span> to the Web site.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p04">SEO is an extremely effective way of generating new business to a site. It is a continuous process and a way of thinking about how search engines see your Web site and how users use search engines to find your Web site. It’s search psychology.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_p05">SEO is a fairly technical practice, but it can easily be broken down into five main areas:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s02_l03">

    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p02">Keyword or key phrase? Key phrases are made up of keywords, but you can get away with referring to a key phrase as keywords.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p03">Search engines have built a sophisticated understanding of semantics and the way we use language. So, if a user searches for “car rental,” the search engine will look for pages that are relevant to “car rental” as well as possibly “car hire,” “vehicle hire,” and so forth. Search engines have also built up knowledge around common misspellings and synonyms and common related searches so as to try to return the best results for a user.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p04">Because of this, it is crucial that Web sites contain content with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">keywords</a><span class="glossdef">A word or words used by a searcher on a search engine. In SEO, keywords are the words that a Web site is optimized to rank for, and in PPC, keywords are bid on by advertisers.</span></span> that are likely to be used by their target audience. Web sites need to appear when their potential customers are searching for them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p05">As a Web site owner, or the marketer for a Web site, we need to build a list of some of the terms our potential customers are likely to use to find the things we are offering. A big part of keyword research is understanding search psychology. When we build our key phrase or keyword list, we are tapping into the mental process of searchers and putting together the right mix of keywords to target.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p06">There are four things to consider when choosing a keyword:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Search volume</strong>. How many searchers are using that phrase to find what they want? For example, there is an estimated monthly search volume of over two million for the keyword “hotel” but an estimated 385 searches per month for a keyword like “Cape Town waterfront hotel.”</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Competition</strong>. How many other Web sites out there are targeting that same phrase? For example, Google finds over 611,000,000 results for “hotel” but only 14,800 for “Cape Town Waterfront Hotel.”</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Propensity to convert</strong>. What is the likelihood that the searcher using that key phrase is going to convert on your site? A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversion</a><span class="glossdef">A visitor completing a target action.</span></span> is a desired action taken by the visitor to your Web site. Related to propensity to convert is the relevance of the selected term to what you are offering. If you are selling rooms at a hotel at the V&amp;A Waterfront, which of the two terms (“hotel” and “Cape Town Waterfront hotel”) do you think will lead to more conversions?</li>
        <li>
            <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Value per conversion</strong>. What is the average value per prospect attracted by the keyword? Depending on the nature of your Web site, the average value per lead varies. Using the hotel example again, consider these two terms: “luxury Cape Town hotel” and “budget Cape Town hotel.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_p07">Both are terms used by someone looking to book a hotel in Cape Town, but it is likely that someone looking for a luxury hotel is intending to spend more. That means that particular lead has a higher value, particularly if you have a hotel-booking Web site that offers a range of accommodation.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_s02_s02_p01">Think about the words you would use to describe your business and about the questions or needs of your customers that it fulfils. How would someone ask for what you are offering? Consider synonyms and misspellings as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s03_s02_s02_p02">Bear in mind that people might not ask for your services in the same way you describe them. You might sell “herbal infusions,” whereas most people would ask for “herbal teas,” although some might request a “tisane.” If you are selling Tamagotchis, remember that the spelling can be tough to recall, and you might need to consider common misspellings like “tumagochi” or “tamagochi.”</p>

            <li>Understand the importance of optimizing content for key phrases.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_p01">Once keywords and phrases are selected, we need to ensure that the site contains content to target those key phrases. We must ensure that the content is properly structured and that it sends signals of relevance. Content is the most important part of your Web site. We must create relevant, targeted content aiming at our selected key phrases. Content already has several roles to play on your site:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_l02">
        <li>It provides information to visitors.</li>
        <li>It must engage them.</li>
        <li>It must convince them to do what you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_p02">Now it must also send signals of relevance to search engines. You need to use the keywords on the content page in a way that search engines will pick up and users will understand.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_p03">Each Web page should be optimized for two to three key phrases: the primary key phrase, the secondary key phrase, and the tertiary key phrase. A page can be optimized for up to five key phrases, but it is better to have more niche pages than fewer unfocused pages. Here are some guidelines:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_l03">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Title tag</a><span class="glossdef">Use the key phrase in the title and as close to the beginning as possible.</span></span>. Use the key phrase in the title and as close to the beginning as possible.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">H1 header tag</strong>. Use the key phrase in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">header tag</a><span class="glossdef">Heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) are standard elements used to define headings and subheadings on a Web page. The number indicates the importance, so H1 tags are viewed by the spiders as being more important that the H3 tags. Using targeted key phrases in your H tags is essential for effective SEO.</span></span> and as much as possible in the other H tags.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Body content</strong>. Use the key phrase at least three times, or more if there is a lot of content and it makes sense. Aim for about 350 words of content, but don’t overdo it! That could look like spam to the search engines.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bold</strong>. Use <strong class="emphasis bold">tags around the keyword at least once</strong>.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Alt tag for an image</strong>. Use the key phrase at least once to describe an image on the page.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">URL (uniform resource locator)</strong>. Use a URL rewrite so that it appears in the URL of the page.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meta description</strong>. Use it at least once in the meta description of the page. It should entice users to click through to your site from the search engine results page (SERP).</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meta tags</strong>. Use the keywords in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">meta tags</a><span class="glossdef">Meta tags are there to tell the spiders exactly what the Web pages are about. It’s important that your meta tags are optimized for the targeted key phrases. Meta tags are made up of meta titles, descriptions, and keywords.</span></span> to provide context to the search engines.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Linked anchor text to another page</strong>. Don’t use it when linking to another page on your site. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anchor text</a><span class="glossdef">The visible, clickable text in a link.</span></span> describes the page being linked to, and so could dilute the relevance of the page you are linking from.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Domain name</strong>. If possible, use the key phrase in your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">domain name</a><span class="glossdef">The name of a Web site that distinguishes it from other systems on the World Wide Web.</span></span>, although favor usability or memorable domain names.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p01">Images should also be optimized with the relevant keywords. Search engines cannot see images, so rely on the way that an image is described to determine what the image is about. Screen readers also read out the image descriptions, which can help visually impaired readers to make sense of a Web site. Lastly, images are sometimes also shown on the SERPs, and of course one can also search images using most of the major search engines.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p02">Just as an image can help emphasize the content on a page, it can also help search engines in ranking pages, provided the image is labeled correctly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p03">Here are some ways to optimize images with key phrases for search engine optimization (SEO):</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Use descriptive filenames.</li>
            <li>Use specific alt tags and title attributes for the images.</li>
            <li>Meta information can be supplied in the image file. Make sure this information is relevant.</li>
            <li>Use descriptive captions, and keep relevant copy close to the relevant image.</li>
            <li>Make sure the header tags and images are relevant to each other.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p04">SEO is both a science and an art. Focusing on writing quality content while sticking to a few guidelines when it comes to tags and URLs is the best way to ensure results. Remember, you want search engines to rank you highly for your content, but you also want to ensure that the content is a pleasure to read.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p05">Adding fresh content that carries brand values regularly to your site will also encourage the search engines to crawl your site more frequently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s04_s02_p06">Use your Web site and its pages to establish and reinforce themes. Information can always be arranged in some kind of hierarchical structure. Just as a single page can have a heading and then get broken down into subheadings, a large Web site can have main themes that get broken down into subthemes. Search engines will see these themes and recognize that your Web site contains rich content.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p01">Links are a vital part of how the Internet works. The purpose of a link is to allow a user to go from one Web page to another. Search engines, doing their best to mimic the behavior of humans, also follow links.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p02">Besides allowing search engine spiders to find Web sites, links are also a way of validating relevance and indicating importance. When one page links to another, it is as if that page is voting or vouching for the destination page. Generally, the more votes a Web site receives, the more trusted it becomes, the more important it is deemed, and the better it will rank on search engines.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p03">Links help send signals of trust. Signals of trust can only come from a third-party source. Few people will trust someone who says, “Don’t worry, you can trust me” unless someone else, who is already trusted says, “Don’t worry, I know him well. You can trust him.” It is the same with links and search engines. Trusted sites can transfer trust to unknown sites via links.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p04">Links help validate relevance. Text links, by their very nature, contain text (thank you, Captain Obvious). The text that makes up the link can help validate relevance. A link like “Cape Town hotel” sends the message that says, “You can trust that the destination site is relevant to the term ‘Cape Town hotel.’” If the destination Web page has already used content to send a signal of relevance, the link simply validates that signal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p04">The link sends a signal that the target URL (uniform resource locator) is important for the subject of the anchor text.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p01">Of course, not all links are equal. Some sites are more trusted than others. So if they are more trusted, then links from those sites are worth more. Likewise, some sites are more relevant than others to specific terms. The more relevant a site, the more value is transferred by the link. Well-known and established news sites, government sites (.gov), and university domains (.edu) are examples of sites from which links can carry more weight.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p02">Search algorithms also consider relationships between linked sites. By analyzing various things, the engines try to determine if the links are natural links or if they are manipulative, artificial links created solely for ranking purposes. Manipulated links are worth very little compared to natural links and may lead to a drop in search engine rankings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p03">The search engine algorithm will also determine the relevancy of the referring Web site to the site being linked to. The more relevant the sites are to each other, the better.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_l01">
            <li>Understand where the future of SEO (search engine optimization) is headed.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_p01">SEO (search engine optimization) is a constantly evolving activity. As the search engine algorithms become more sophisticated, they assess Web sites in more complex ways to arrive at suitable search results. There are significant changes on the horizon in how search engines will index and present their results. These changes are aligned with a goal of sorting through the exponentially increasing amounts of data available on the Web and giving users better and more targeted search results, which they will find useful.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_p02">There are four strong emerging trends for SEO:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_l02">
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Localization</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of creating a local version of a Web site for a different country or language.</span></span></li>
        <li>Personalized search</li>
        <li>Usage data</li>
        <li>Real-time search</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_p03">These four trends are making optimizing Web sites for search engines even more complex.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Localization and Personalization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p01">The first two trends revolve around how the search engines are trying to accommodate the geographic and personal preferences of a user so as to present them with the best contextual results. By localizing, the search engines are presenting information in the language and geographic context of the user.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p02">In personalizing search, the search engines are trying to align with what they have determined would be more appropriate for that specific user. Personalized search targets users’ preferences on two bases: explicitly and implicitly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p03">Explicit personalized search is based on an interpretation, by the search engines, of data and information the users provide directly to search engines, such as location, age, language, and gender.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p04">Implicit personalized search is based on data and information search engines gather by analyzing users’ behavior. Search engines will track the pages users frequently visit or how they use certain sites—such as Gmail or bookmarking sites. Based on this, the search engines will predict what a user is probably interested in and tailor the results it presents to that user accordingly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p05">Surveys suggest that users are generally in favor of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personalization</a><span class="glossdef">Search results are personalized to, or vary according to, what search engines think a user is actually interested in.</span></span> and are willing to trade personal information to benefit from better-quality results from the search engines. Large search engines, like Google, are even offering end users the opportunity to tell them what results they like—through the launch of user feedback mechanisms such as Google Search Wiki (launched in 2008).This kind of functionality allows the user to tell search engines what results they like or don’t like and would like to see (or not) again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_p06">To optimize a site properly, factors like personalization and localization need to be taken into account and the site needs to be honed to do the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s02_l01">
            <li>Adapt to how the search engines will measure and index the sites</li>
            <li>Adapt to how users will expect to be presented with contextualized information</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Usage Data</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_p01">Search engines want their results to be highly relevant to Web users to make sure that Web users keep returning to the search engine for future searches. And the best way to establish relevance to users—how they use Web sites, of course!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_p02">Usage data are the most effective way of judging the true relevancy and value of a Web site. For example, if users arrive on a Web site and go back immediately, chances are it wasn’t relevant to their query in the first place. However, if a user repeatedly visits a Web site and spends a long time on the site, chances are it is extremely relevant. When it comes to search engines, relevant valuable sites get promoted, and irrelevant sites get demoted.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">How Do Search Engines Access These Data?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02_p01">Search engines use cookies to maintain a history of a user’s search activity. This will include keywords used and Web sites visited from the search engine. Search engines gather data on the click-through rate of results and on bounce rates.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02_p02">Most search engines also provide other services, all of which can be used to gather data relevant to search. For Google, some examples of these services include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>Google AdWords</li>
                <li>Google AdSense</li>
                <li>Google Analytics</li>
                <li>Google Web Site Optimizer</li>
                <li>Google Checkout</li>
                <li>Google Toolbar</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02_p03">As of 2010, this is a relatively new area of SEO. It no doubt plays a part in search engine rankings, and that contribution is set to grow. So what does this mean for SEO? When it comes to a Web site, SEO must do the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s02_l02">
                <li>Be valuable enough to attract both visitors and links naturally</li>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s03_p02">In 2006, Google found that the BMW Germany Web site <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://bmw.de">http://bmw.de</a> was using a JavaScript URL (uniform resource locator) redirect to send search engine spiders and Web visitors to different pages with different content. It was removed from the Google index until the Webmaster had ensured that the Web site met Google’s guidelines.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s03_l01">
                <li>Avoid hidden text or hidden links.</li>
                <li>Don’t use cloaking or sneaky redirects.</li>
                <li>Don’t send automated queries to Google.</li>
                <li>Don’t load pages with irrelevant keywords.</li>
                <li>Don’t create multiple pages, subdomains, or domains with substantially duplicate content.</li>
                <li>Don’t create pages with malicious behavior, such as phishing or installing viruses, trojans, or other malware.</li>
                <li>Avoid “doorway” pages created just for search engines, or other “cookie cutter” approaches such as affiliate programs with little or no original content.</li>
                <li>If your site participates in an affiliate program, make sure that your site adds value. Provide unique and relevant content that gives users a reason to visit your site first.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s03_s03_p04">The bottom line: design Web sites for users first and foremost, and don’t try to trick the search engines.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s04_p01">Google offered a new feature called real-time search, which went live in December 2009. It’s designed to further increase the optimal user experience with search and follows earlier features on Google search engine results pages (SERPs), which now regularly include images, news items, videos, and shopping listings. With real-time search, Google now displays a dynamic function in its SERPS, where you can see the latest mentions or URLs published on the Web, related to your search term.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s04_p02">This is ideal for social media and microblogging purposes, and Google has partnered with the likes of Twitter, MySpace, FriendFeed, Jaiku, Identi.ca, and other online businesses to offer this initiative.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s05_s10_p01">Optimizing a Web site for search engines should entail optimizing the Web site for users.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s05_s10_p02">However, it can be tempting to focus on the technicalities of SEO while forgetting that both robots and humans need to read the same Web site. One should not be sacrificed for the other.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s05_s10_p03">Search engines update their algorithms regularly. Each update is an attempt to improve search results but can result in loss of rankings for some Web sites, depending on the update. A contingency plan, such as a prepared PPC (pay-per-click) campaign, needs to be in place to cope with a sudden drop in rankings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s06_s05_s10_p04">As with any eMarketing practice, SEO should not be the only focus of eMarketing efforts. It works best when part of a holistic eMarketing strategy.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">6.7</span> Case Study: Yachting Partners International</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p01">Founded in 1972, Yachting Partners International (YPI) is one of the world’s premier yacht brokerage companies, offering services on everything from yacht chartering, acquisitions, and sales to construction and management from their head office in England.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p02">The yacht business is extremely competitive, whether online or offline. The YPI Web site needed to stand out from the crowd and be recognized as the authority on yachting and charter holidays. To ensure that this was possible, the keyword strategy matched these objectives and gave YPI prominence on the search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p03">The search engine optimization (SEO) strategy dictated a need for high-traffic terms rather than niche, long-tail phrases. This would ensure that YPI was above the fold for important searches. During the keyword research phase, primary keywords were allocated to the key themes up for optimization. Secondary and tertiary keywords represented the supporting terms and any relevant synonyms.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p04">Before optimization, the YPI site didn’t have many of the required elements for a <strong class="emphasis bold">successful SEO campaign</strong>. The technical considerations, essential to a site’s success, work hand in hand with traditional, keyword, and theme-focused SEO efforts.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p05">The technical considerations that first needed to be addressed included the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_l01">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Metadata</strong>. The creation of descriptive and unique meta descriptions that included keyword-dense copy helped reflect the content found on each page while also issuing a call to action for the user on the SERPs.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Title tags</strong>. The title tags were optimized to contain keywords that were specific and unique to the optimized pages. Used as links on SERPs, the tags were now both keyword rich and enticing.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Header tags</strong>. The hypertext markup language (HTML) header tags, with their new keywords, put emphasis on themes by using properly styled and valid HTML markup.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_f02">
        <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.4</span> Search Results for YPI</p>
        <img src="section_09/de86fc7071357f9ddbcbaa579a3d90c6.jpg">
    </div>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) validity</strong>. Ensuring valid markups enabled the site to be viewed across various Web browsers and operating systems, while also allowing search engine spiders to easily navigate and index the site and determine the relevance of the content.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Canonicalization</strong>. This was implemented to ensure that if a user types in a URL, or clicks on a link directing to http://ypi.co.uk, they will be redirected to the correct URL (uniform resource locator), <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ypi.co.uk">http://www.ypi.co.uk</a>. This is important to avoid losing out on traffic and “link juice,” which is the page rank or link authority passed on by the search engines indexing a page.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">404 error pages</strong>. A customized error page provided an enhanced usability perspective. This assisted users who came upon an error page as a result of clicking on a broken link or who had found the site through a page that was still indexed but no longer existent.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Site map</strong>. Updated and optimized HTML and XML (extensible markup language) site maps were added to the YPI Web site for seamless navigation by humans or search engine robots.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">JavaScript</strong>. JavaScript elements added enhanced functionality to the site (that is not present in standard HTML).</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Link building, Web public relations, and pay per click</strong>. Web public relations (WebPR), link-building articles, and an additional PPC (pay-per-click) campaign helped focus the complete search engine marketing (SEM) package.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s07_p06">The results that occurred after these changes were implemented really speak for themselves. During the initial stages of the optimization, the Yachting Partners International Web site had only a handful of inbound links and indexed pages but currently has <strong class="emphasis bold">1,350 pages indexed</strong> by Google; 7,830 indexed by MSN; and 1,688 by Yahoo! HTML and XML site maps have been implemented to assist with search engine indexing.</p>
