    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch01_s03_p03">A hyperlink is a virtual link from one document on the World Wide Web to another. It includes the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">uniform resource locator (URL)</a><span class="glossdef">The unique identifying address of any particular page on the Web.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch01_s03_p04">A URL provides information to both browsers and people. URLs include domain names, which translate to Internet protocol (IP) addresses.
