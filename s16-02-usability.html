    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p01">When Steve Krug wrote his excellent Web <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">usability</a><span class="glossdef">The measure of a Web site’s ability to accomplish the goals of the user.</span></span> book, he aptly called it <em class="emphasis">Don’t Make Me Think!</em><span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn12_001">Steve Krug, <em class="emphasis">Don’t Make Me Think! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</em>, 2nd ed. (Berkeley, CA: New Riders, 2005).</span> Designing a site for best usability means that users don’t have to figure out what to do; they are just able to do it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p02">Use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standard conventions</a><span class="glossdef">Elements such as links, menus, colors, and layout that are distinct and can be recognized easily by users.</span></span>, such as links that are distinct (blue and underlined is standard), menus top or left, and the logo in the top left-hand corner. Search boxes are usually on the top of the page and should use standard wording such as “search” on buttons. Following standards for important elements that are familiar to Web users means that they know immediately where to look for or how to use them. Important elements (such as menus, logos, colors, and layout) should be distinct, easy to find, and consistent throughout the Web site.</p>

In some countries, accessibility is a legal requirement of government Web sites. Some key points of accessibility include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_l02">
        <li>Ensuring that the Web site and all its functions are compatible across a range of browsers, including text-only and mobile browsers</li>
        <li>Making sure that the Web site is functional to users who might have a disability. Some ways of doing so include the easy increasing or decreasing of text size and using meaningful descriptive tags in the code for when the site is accessed through a screen reader.</li>
        <li>Not designing for high-bandwidth users only but instead making sure that low-bandwidth users do not have to wait for heavy page loads to access your Web site (unless you have a good marketing reason for keeping those users out)</li>
        <li>Having a search box (that works) available</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p10"><strong class="emphasis bold">Content</strong> needs to be written so that users can grab the information they need in as little time as possible. Text can be made more easily readable by doing the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_l03">
        <li>Highlighting or making bold key phrases and words</li>
        <li>Using bulleted lists</li>
        <li>Using paragraphs to break up information</li>
        <li>Using descriptive and distinct headings</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p11">On the page, use an inverted pyramid style, or newspaper style, for your copy. The bulk of the information should be at the top of the page to make for easy scanning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p12">There are some key “don’ts” when it comes to building a user-friendly Web site:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_l04">
        <li>Never resize windows or launch the site in a pop-up.</li>
        <li>Don’t use splash pages. These are pages at the entry to a site that are usually animated and contain some variation of the phrase “click here to enter this site.”</li>
        <li>Never build a site entirely in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Flash</a><span class="glossdef">A proprietary technology used to show video and animation; can be bandwidth heavy and unfriendly to search engine spiders.</span></span>—most search engine spiders cannot even crawl Flash sites.</li>
        <li>Don’t distract users with “Christmas trees” (blinking images, flashing lights, automatic sound, scrolling text, unusual fonts, etc.).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s02_p13">Usability and accessibility guidelines are useful for checking that all elements have been dealt with.
