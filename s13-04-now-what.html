        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s02_p01">Anticipate wild success and ensure that the server can cope with the additional traffic. Nothing will kill a campaign faster than it being unavailable, and this has happened countless times.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Ensure that all parties know about the viral marketing campaign so that they can be prepared for any feedback that arises from this. If there is a cryptic element involved, or information that should not be released, ensure that all employees know about this.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s02_p03">If the campaign is to increase sales, be sure that there is sufficient stock in place.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s03_p01">With millions of people being exposed to a brand, a company should plan to make the most of this first contact. As well providing all the tools to send a campaign on, a well-planned campaign will also ask their audience permission to keep in touch with them. Build on the nature of the campaign and ensure that future communications are not far removed from the viral campaign.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s04_p01">Consider the additional traffic and traction if the campaign becomes a case study, archived and accessed by marketers, journalists, and other interested parties. Make the most of this additional latent traffic avenue by preparing useful case studies, screenshots, and contact details. Even though the viral marketing campaign may be over, make sure it appears in online conversations and continues to generate traffic and links for your company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s04_p02">If possible, keep relevant Web sites up and running and games still available once a campaign has finished.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch09_s04_s05_p02">Astroturfing usually occurs in the seeding period of a campaign. Employees may use fake names to try to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">seed</a><span class="glossdef">The process of initiating a viral campaign through strategic online placement.</span></span> a campaign on forums, in blog comments, and through services such as Digg (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.digg.com">http://www.digg.com</a>). Communities are quick to pick up on false commentary, and this can be disastrous for a campaign. As with all social media interactions, transparency and authenticity can be far better for traction.</p>
