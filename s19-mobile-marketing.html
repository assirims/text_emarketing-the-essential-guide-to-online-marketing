<span class="title-prefix">16.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p01">The mobile phone is a small gadget that has had a huge impact on our day-to-day lives. It has already had a profound impact on the way we communicate and conduct ourselves daily. This continues to be felt as the mobile phone enables new ways to market and new markets in which to transact.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p02">The Internet transformed our world in two fundamental ways: it has given anyone with access to the Internet the opportunity to interact easily with others (and with companies and brands), and through search, it has made information easily available. Content and information have become readily and freely available. Developed as a platform for academics to share information, the Web has a strong ethos of free content.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p03">Mobile phones are a developing technology, which means that new and better features are being packed into ever smaller devices, adding to the interactivity and searchability of the Internet with several fundamental features native to the mobile phone and the way we use it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p04">While the Internet and the personal computer have had a profound impact on the world we transact in, it is the mobile phone that presents an exciting opportunity for even more of the world to access the benefits of these inventions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p05">Consider that there are 1.7 billion people worldwide with access to the Internet. Of those, 1.3 billion are active users of e-mail. With the world’s population at 6.7 billion, that’s almost a fifth of the population who can be reached by e-mail. That needs to be compared to 4.1 billion mobile phone subscribers—more than half of the world’s population. And of that 4.1 billion, 3 billion were active users of short message service (SMS) text messaging in 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn15_001">Tomi Ahonen, <em class="emphasis">Tomi Ahonen Almanac 2010: The Mobile Telecoms Industry Annual Review</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomiahonen.com/ebook/almanac.html">http://www.tomiahonen.com/ebook/almanac.html</a> (accessed May 11, 2010); Mocom2020, “4.1 Billion Mobile Phone Subscribers Worldwide,” March 27, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mocom2020.com/2009/03/41-billion-mobile-phone-subscribers-worldwide">http://www.mocom2020.com/2009/03/41-billion-mobile-phone- subscribers-worldwide</a> (accessed December 17, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s01_p06">Looking at figures like that, it’s obvious why so many organizations are investigating the mobile phone as a marketing platform.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">16.2</span> Why the Mobile Phone?</h2>
    <div class="learning_objectives editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_l01">
            <li>Understand how mobile marketing became an important eMarketing tool.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_p01">The mobile phone is a sophisticated device. Today’s phones can act as alarm clocks, cameras, video recorders, MP3 players, calendars, notebooks, and messaging devices, and they can even make voice calls. However, it is not the aforementioned plethora of features that makes the mobile phone such an attractive device. The following seven features are what turn mobile phones into something truly remarkable for marketers:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_l02">
        <li>The mobile phone is personal.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone is always carried.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone is always on.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone has a built-in payment system.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone is available at the point of creative inspiration.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone can provide accurate audience measurements.</li>
        <li>The mobile phone captures the social context of media consumption.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn15_002">Tomi Ahonen, “Deeper Insights into the 7th Mass Media Channel, Mobile Is to the Internet, What TV Is to Radio,” Communities Dominate Brands, May 2, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2008/05/deeper-insights.html">http://www.communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2008/05/deeper-insights.html</a> (accessed December 15, 2008).</span>
</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_p02">If you consider your relationship with your mobile phone, these features should make sense. However, a few facts and figures never hurt anyone, and the following elaborates more fully on the aforementioned features.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Is Personal</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s02_p01">A 2006 survey found that 63 percent of respondents would not share their phones with anyone (90 percent of those surveyed in Japan would not share their phones).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn15_003">“Wireless Works,” BBDO and Proximity, April 2006.</span> While laptops do present a personal connection to the Internet, they are not as personal a device as the mobile phone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s02_p02">The implication for marketers is that respect for privacy and permission is exceptionally important in all aspects of marketing, and particularly so when it comes to mobile phones.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Is Always Carried</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s03_p01">What do you take with you when you leave your house? Wallet, keys, and mobile phone. What do you keep always near you when you are in your house? Mobile phone. According to 2007 research by Morgan Stanley, 91 percent of mobile phone owners keep their phone within three feet, twenty-four hours a day.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn15_004">Tomi Ahonen, “Deeper Insights into the 7th Mass Media Channel, Mobile Is to the Internet, What TV Is to Radio,” Communities Dominate Brands, May 2, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2008/05/deeper-insights.html">http://www.communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2008/05/deeper-insights.html</a> (accessed December 15, 2008).</span> People have their phones with them at all times of the day, even in the bathroom.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s03_p02">The implication for marketers is that messages sent to recipients can be read and acted on immediately. Unlike, for example, e-mail, which requires that the recipient be in front of his or her computer and connected to the Internet, messages sent to mobile phones will most likely be accessed within minutes of being received.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Is Always On</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s04_p01">In order to fulfill its primary function—as a telephone—the mobile phone is always on. Messages and services can be sent and acted on at all times of the day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s04_p02">As with the previous feature of the phone, the fact that the phone is always on has implications for marketers; it changes the services and messages that can be developed for the phone. It also means that marketers need to be perhaps even more sensitive with their marketing communications. Not many people would appreciate a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">short message service (SMS)</a><span class="glossdef">Electronic messages sent on wireless networks.</span></span> at four in the morning informing them of a special offer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Has a Built-In Payment System</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s05_p01">This is perhaps the key feature of the mobile phone and one reason why content for mobile phones in many areas generates as much or more revenue than content for the Internet. Every mobile phone has a built-in payment mechanism—the subscriber identity module (SIM) card. Billing is easily handled through the user’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mobile network</a><span class="glossdef">The facilities and technology that make a public mobile telecommunications service possible.</span></span>. Not only do mobile phones have this built-in payment mechanism, but also paying for content and downloads has been built into the way that consumers use their phones. There is less of an expectation that goods and services will be free, although as the mobile app market expands, this is changing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s05_p02">There are also a number of services that turn the mobile into a virtual wallet or bank card, bringing banking and payment services to people all around the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s05_p03">iChannel, a mobile news ticker feed in Japan, generates US$192 million per year in subscriptions for its US$2-a-month service. It has more paying subscribers on this single service that all online newspapers in the world combined.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn15_005">Alan Moore, “The Glittering Allure of the Mobile Society,” white paper, SMLXL, November 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://andrewgrill.com/download/AlanMoore_Allure_Mobile_Society.pdf">http://andrewgrill.com/download/AlanMoore_Allure_Mobile _Society.pdf</a> (accessed December 3, 2008).</span> Similar cases can be made for games, music, and other mobile content.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s05_p04">The implication for marketers is that consumers are willing to pay for services and content on their mobile phone. Advertising is not the only way to generate revenue for content.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Is Available at the Point of Creative Inspiration</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s06_p01">As the mobile phone is always carried and always on, it is always available as a creative tool. Phones today feature a number of tools that let users act on creative impulse, from taking photos and videos, to becoming a scribbling pad on which to jot down ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s06_p02">The implication for marketers is that these features can be used to encourage interactivity with campaigns created for mobile phones. It presents the mobile phone as a useful tool in viral campaigns based on consumer-generated content.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s06_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Can Provide Accurate Audience Measurements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s07_p01">While the Internet is vastly superior to other media in its ability to track and measure advertising and marketing campaigns, it is eclipsed by the mobile phone. Every transaction made on a mobile phone can be uniquely tracked to that mobile phone number, whether the transaction is a voice call, an SMS message, or accessing the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s07_p02">The implication for marketers is that aggregated data provide extensive profiling and segmenting opportunities for targeting the right audience. Campaigns can also be accurately measured and tracked for ROI (return on investment). Bear in mind as well that this accurate measurement means that mobile phone users have far less anonymity than Internet users. Even though at least 50 percent of mobile phones worldwide are on a prepaid or pay-as-you-go type of contract (which means that the network <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">operators</a><span class="glossdef">A function that operates on or modifies other functions.</span></span> do not have the phone user’s name and demographic details to go with the mobile number), each transaction made by the phone user can still be measured.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s07_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s07_p03">The Mobile Marketing Association has an in-depth glossary of mobile marketing terminology available as a free download from its Web site, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mmaglobal.com">http://www.mmaglobal.com</a>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Mobile Phone Captures the Social Context of Media Consumption</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s08_p01">This represents emerging thinking on the benefits of the mobile phone. Because of the nature of the mobile phone to be able to accurately track transactions to any particular phone number (user), it can track transactions between mobile numbers (between users). This means that sophisticated data mining can identify patterns that indicate information about and preferences of mobile phone users. Not only can alpha users be identified, but they may also be identified within their social context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s08_p02">The implication for marketers is that this information will represent rich data that can be used to both create and market products, content, and services online.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Limitations of the Mobile Phone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s09_p01">The mobile phone is a feature-packed gadget used all around the world by almost half the world’s population. However, as much as the mobile phone has a number of unique benefits, it does come with its own challenges.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s09_p02">The mobile phone is small. This means that it has a small screen and a small keypad. While some phones have a full <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">QWERTY</a><span class="glossdef">A full keypad like the one found on computers.</span></span> keypad, many have the standard numeric keypad. When it comes to the mobile Web, consider that phones do not have a mouse. There are a few models that have touch screens, but for the most part, navigation of the mobile Web is through the keypad or scroll buttons on the phone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s09_p03">Mobile phones are also even less standard than PCs. Not only do phone models present a myriad of screen sizes, there are also several operating systems and browsers that are used by mobile phones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s02_s09_p04">Use of more advanced features of phones can require an extensive education process. While mobile phones have a host of features, these devices are for the most part underused.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s03_s02_p02">Mobile phones started as literally phones that are mobile (thank you again, Captain Obvious). Before we look at mobile phones as devices used to access the World Wide Web, to take photographs, or to make payments, we need to address their primary function: communication. The primary use of a mobile phone is to enable communication, either through voice calls or through messages. Messaging services on a mobile phone use either short message service (SMS) to send text messages or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multimedia message service (MMS)</a><span class="glossdef">An extension on SMS (short message service); allows picture, sound, or low-quality videos to be sent on a wireless network.</span></span> to send graphics, audio, photos, and video as well as text. Messages can, of course, also be sent via e-mail depending on the phone’s features.</p>

CSCs are phone numbers (short ones, as the name implies) to which users can send a text message from a mobile phone, usually to get something in return. CSCs can be used to sign up for services, to enter competitions, or to indicate permission (or to end permission) to receive marketing messages. Messages sent to CSCs can also be used to make a payment or a donation, with a set amount being deducted from a user’s prepaid airtime or monthly airtime bill.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_p03">Metropolitan Life, a South African insurance company, launched a new service called Cover2Go in 2007. Cover2Go is aimed at those on lower incomes in South Africa and has made innovative use of mobile phone technology in order to reach its target market. Cover2Go insurance can be purchased by SMS; a single transaction can purchase instant life insurance for six days.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_p04">All a customer needs to do to purchase coverage is to SMS their name and identity number to a premium-rate CSC. The system, powered by Clickatell, replies with a confirmation and policy number, requests the name of a beneficiary, and reminds the policyholder to inform an associate about the life insurance. All this costs the customer only about $1, which is automatically deducted from the phone’s airtime and gives him six days’ worth of coverage.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_p05">Cover2Go’s innovative use of mobile phone technology makes insurance incredibly accessible to this market. The use of SMS technology ensures that the insurance is easy to purchase, and deducting the cost of the coverage from the phone’s airtime makes it easy to pay for the insurance.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_p01">With twice as many SMS users worldwide as e-mail, SMS should be a no-brainer for marketers. However, mobile phone users have proved reluctant to hand over their phone number for marketing messages, perhaps fearing a similar deluge of spam for which e-mail has such a poor reputation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_p02">This is changing to some extent, with the prevalence of CSCs being used in marketing and advertising campaigns. As consumers are so comfortable with using text messages for their communication, no extensive education process is required to have consumers access marketing campaigns based on CSCs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_p03">CSCs can be used to receive messages from consumers and to send messages to consumers. CSCs can be either dedicated (used by one company and presumably for one campaign) or shared. When CSCs are shared, keywords in the text message are used to separate the messages. There are two standard keywords that should always elicit a standard response:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_s02_p01">Once prospects have given you permission to communicate with them and their mobile number, timely messages can be sent to their mobile phone. These can be promotional or sales messages, such as special offers in stores or information about upcoming events. On many phones, prospects need to at least open an SMS message in order to delete it. As well as this, mobile phones are generally kept with a prospect at all times, meaning that messages are more likely to be read very soon after they have been broadcast.</p>

They provide a fast, instant, and trackable means for the public to enter competitions, voice opinions, or make requests. Even better for a company, the costs can often be passed on to the consumer, meaning that it can be a cost-effective way to receive marketing messages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_s05_p02">As CSCs can be shared, keywords can be used to separate communications and campaigns. For example, a user might be asked to text the word “LUXURY” to a number in order to enter a competition.</p>

All they had to do was text the word “MOVIE” to a particular number, and in return they would receive a unique code with which to claim their discounted tickets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s04_s02_s09_p02">In return, Orange then sent the list of prospects who requested discounts information about the movies being shown at their local cinema.

Uses a variation of time-division multiple access.</span></span> (Global System for Mobile Communications) networks. Unlike SMS, USSD is a protocol that allows for a query-and-response type of action between the customer and a service center, where these transactions can be seen to be similar to a session on a Web site. USSD services are usually initiated by the user who enters a code on his phone and then sends that as a request to the network. The code differs from the number an SMS is sent to because it includes the symbols # and *. For example, *100# can be used to check the balance of a prepaid service on some networks. These services are often used by networks to provide a service to a customer, such as requesting balance information, adding credit to a prepaid contract, or passing on credit to another mobile phone user. A popular service is a “call back” functionality, where a mobile phone user sends a request by USSD for another user to phone him. The requested number receives an SMS informing her of the request. Often, this SMS message also includes an advertising message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s05_s03_p02">A USSD query often initiates a session where the response from the service includes a simple text menu with further options or a response with instructions for the user. Users need to respond within a limited time frame, usually thirty seconds but up to two minutes, in order to maintain the session. If the session is not maintained, the user will need to initiate the service again. Users can select menu options by returning a message with the number of the appropriate menu selection. This continues until the appropriate content has been displayed. It is a rudimentary navigation, but with far faster response times and lower costs when compared to SMS or to mobile browsing.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p01">USSD is being used as a payment application, turning the mobile phone into a virtual wallet.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p02">USSD is exceptionally useful as self-service customer service and is attractive to customers when it is offered for free. Advertising can easily be displayed in the messages returned when using this service.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p03">Voting, such as for a reality television program, and entering of competitions can all be handled through USSD. USSD services allow greater flexibility than SMS services as they allow a query-and-response type of interaction as opposed to a single message to perform these tasks. This allows the marketer to request additional information from consumers using these services.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s05_s03_s02_p04">USSD can be used to provide information to, and collect information from, customers and potential customers. However, from a marketing and advertising perspective, its adoption has not been as great as that of SMS. While USSD services are more cost effective than SMS services and can allow for more detailed data to be collected, SMS services are often preferred by the customer. SMS common short codes (CSCs) are easier to remember than USSD codes, and the concept of sending a text message is more familiar to the customer.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p01">As much as Web sites need to cater to a number of browsers, they now need to cater to a number of devices, as more and more people are using their mobile phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and other mobile devices to connect to the Internet. However, visits from mobile devices are likely to be quite different from the visits from PCs. Visits from mobile phone users are likely to be more purpose driven or task specific, as opposed to leisurely browsing from PCs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p02">Just as with PCs, mobile phones can have different operating systems and different browsers, both affecting the way that Web sites and Web pages are viewed and used. In addition to this, Web pages are viewed on far smaller (and nonstandard) screens, and navigation is controlled through a keyboard or limited scrolling device. There are also a number of different ways that mobile phones and devices connect to the Internet. In particular, mobile phones can use the GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network—where access is via <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)</a><span class="glossdef">Delivers wireless packet data services to GSM customers.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates of GSM Evolution)</a><span class="glossdef">A faster version of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) wireless service. It enables data to be delivered at rates up to 384 kilobytes per second (kbps) on a broadband connection.</span></span>, or 3G (third generation), depending on availability—or Wi-Fi-enabled devices can connect to wireless networks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p03">WAP stands for wireless application protocol and is a technology platform aimed at making Web sites accessible to mobile phones, despite the small screens and keypad limitations. WAP is essentially a wireless data connection and browser that can read a pared-down version of HTML (hypertext markup language). If a phone has only WAP access, it can only access Web sites that have been developed for this type of access.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p04">More sophisticated phones and devices, and increasingly almost all phones sold are falling into this category, can use HTML browsers that have been specifically designed for mobile phones. These are pared-down versions of browsers that run on PCs or notebooks and have been specifically designed to take into account the limitations of mobile devices. In particular, browsers need to accommodate both the low bandwidth and the low memory capacity of mobile devices. Mobile browsers also need to cater to the navigation limitations of mobile devices as well as the fact that navigation is not standard across the various models of phones.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_n02">

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p06">When it comes to Web sites and mobile phones, there are three options for Webmasters:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_l02">
        <li>Do nothing and hope that the Web experience is not too painful for mobile visitors.</li>
        <li>Make sure that your Web site is built using a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) compliant CSS (cascading style sheet) so that it can be more easily navigated by mobile visitors.</li>
        <li>Build a separate version of your Web site tailored to mobile visitors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_p07">For certain kinds of Web sites, there are “quick fixes” that allow a mobile version of the Web site to be created fairly easily. For example, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mobilepress.co.za">http://mobilepress.co.za</a> from Younique allows for Web sites and blogs based on the WordPress platform to be made mobile browser friendly. A quick search on Google will also give instructions on how to make small changes to your code in order to create a mobile friendly version of a Web site.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Tailoring Web Sites for Mobile Access</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p01">Some Web sites are more likely to be accessed from mobile phones than others, and savvy Webmasters can make sure that visitors have an excellent experience by building mobile versions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p02">As with all good Web design, the first step is in understanding users’ needs. When accessing a Web site from a mobile phone, a user is generally very task driven, time sensitive, and also likely to be location aware.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Task driven</strong> means that the user has a very specific purpose for visiting a Web site, and the Web site needs to help the user to achieve his objective with minimum fuss. For example, a user might want go to a Web site to check the score of a football game.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Time sensitive</strong> means that the user is even less likely to be able to spend time hunting for a solution to her problem; instead, the user expects to achieve tasks quickly. For example, a user en route to the airport may want to check to see if her flight is on time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Location aware</strong> means that the location of the user often plays a large role in determining her objectives. For example, a user might be looking for restaurant suggestions in a town she is vacationing in.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p06">These need to be factored in when creating Web sites for mobile users. Mobile Web sites need to be easy to navigate, should not contain more information than they need to, and should have services tailored to a user’s location.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_p07">Here are some tips when it comes to designing or optimizing Web sites for mobile users:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep it simple</strong>. Flash is, for now, still only a dream on most phones. Animated graphics interchangeable format (GIF) images are probably your best bet if you want movement, but make sure the main message is contained in the first frame, as this at least will be displayed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stay away from tables</strong>. Most devices will ignore tables, and content will get completely scrambled. Use lists where possible.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use enough links</strong>. Have sufficient links at the top and bottom of each page to easily navigate to other pages on the site, and don’t try to cram too much content onto a page. Unless you have a touch-screen device, scrolling using the keypad is never much fun.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep it portrait oriented</strong>. As most devices are still only able to display content in portrait mode, it is important to keep horizontal scrolling down to a minimum—avoid it completely if possible. Some browsers may resize content to fit the width of the screen, so keep this in mind—it might distort the graphical impact. Depending on requirements, aligning content to the left or center of the screen works quite well.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep images as small as possible</strong>. Most graphical editing tools have a “save for Web or devices” option—use this when possible.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid transparency</strong>. Hover effects on anchor tags are not supported for the most part and making use of the “background-image” directive is bound to give problems on a number of devices.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use JavaScript and Ajax sparingly</strong>. Even though a couple of WAP browsers have been “supporting” JavaScript for a while now, it is still advised to use it sparingly, if at all.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s03_p01">“One Web” refers to ensuring, as far as possible, that the same information and content is available to Web users, regardless of the device they are using to access the Web. So while Web sites should be optimized for presentation on various devices, proponents of “one Web” would argue that the actual content should not be different.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">WAP Push</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p01">WAP push messages are messages sent to a mobile phone that direct the user toward WAP content. While they may appear similar to SMS messages, these are a different type of message. The WAP push message contains a link that a user can follow to access WAP content.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p02">Sending rich messages to mobile phone users can be tricky. Until there is increased general awareness of the types of messages that can be sent to and from mobile phones, MMS (multimedia message service) messages can represent a problematic push-marketing medium. However, a WAP push message can direct users to rich content, enabling a sense of user control over content viewed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p05">Does that sound a little complicated? Essentially, the software that can be installed on the mobile phone turns the phone into a scanner. Information such as URLs (uniform resource locators), telephone numbers, or business names can be encoded in the bar code. When the code is scanned, the information is displayed on the phone. If this is a URL, for instance, the user can then visit that Web site without having to enter any additional information into the phone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p06">There are two encoding types in use: Datamatix (DM) bar codes or Quick Response (QR) bar codes. These can be open source or proprietary. The type of bar code affects the amount of information that may be stored in the bar code, while the standards used can affect the number of bar code readers that can successfully read the bar code.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p07">2D bar codes are often also referred to as tags. These tags can be used in offline advertising and marketing campaigns to push consumers toward specific Web sites. Instead of having to remember and type in a URL, a user simply has to photograph the tag in order to visit the Web site.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s02_p08">Tags can be printed on billboards, on magazine pages, on t-shirts—in fact, on just about anything.

However, in many cases, when this collateral is being viewed by potential customers, it is the mobile phone that is closer to hand than the PC. Remember, the phone is always carried and always on.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s04_p01">Internet search has become an integral part of our lives and is an important part of the mobile marketing mix. However, as with users’ intentions when accessing the mobile Internet, the needs of the user are different when compared to search on a PC.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s04_p02">The limitations of the device, the mobile phone, and the needs of the user are what drive the differences for mobile search.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s04_p03">First, with smaller keypads, whether QWERTY, touch screen, or numeric, users are likely to enter shorter queries into search engines on mobile phones. Search engine results need to be displayed on a smaller screen and need to be easy to navigate.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s04_p04">Users are more task driven when using mobile phones to search, seeking concise information that answers their queries as opposed to using search as part of a discovery process. Just as with search on a PC, there are two types of search listings for mobile phones: natural or organic results and paid-for results.</p>

As technology develops, search providers are able to offer more sophisticated targeting options to advertisers. Geotargeting can be incredibly specific, allowing businesses to offer targeted advertising when a customer is located nearby.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s05_p01">It’s not only Web sites that can be designed specifically for mobile devices. Applications and widgets can be created that are specifically for the mobile phone. For example, Google’s popular e-mail service Gmail can be accessed via the mobile Web, or Gmail users can download a Java application to their phone that gives them access to their Gmail account. The application presents a user experience that has been tailored to the mobile phone and can even be tailored to a particular <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">handset</a><span class="glossdef">A portable or mobile phone.</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s05_p03">As of 2008, apps represent a marketing opportunity for products and companies reaching out to a tech-savvy, affluent community.

It allows users to send and receive text and multimedia messages to and from other users who are connected to the Internet, whether it be between mobile phones, PCs, or between the two. The messages are sent and received via the Internet instead of using SMS technology and also allow users to exchange messages with other IM programs such as MSN Messenger. Although the networks do charge for data costs, this is usually far cheaper than SMS costs, which has driven the large adoption of this service, fourteen million registered users, particularly in the youth market.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s06_p02">As well as being a chat platform, MXit allows its users to customize their profiles by downloading “skinz” (customized profiles, with specific fonts, images, colors, etc.), wallpapers, and emoticards and has its own e-commerce platform (supported by its own currency, Moola) and a music platform.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s04_s06_s02_p01">There are many similarities between Web-based social networks and MXit when it comes to opportunities for marketers. MXit provides social profiling, so that advertising can be served to particular demographics. MXit also allows organizations to set up profiles that users can connect with and chat with. These can be celebrities who want to keep in touch with brands, or cinema chains such as South Africa’s Ster Kinekor, which distribute movie information via the MXit channel.</p>

Rather than immersing the user in a virtual world, however, AR takes computer graphics and superimposes them into “reality”—the physical space around the person operating an AR device. These graphics can be 3D images or simply information tags about a location.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s05_p02">While AR devices are relatively new, they do have a history outside their use in mobile phones. They can and have been used in medicine (superimposing surgical information onto a patient’s body), in architecture (superimposing virtual buildings into a space where they are yet to be built), or for cross-continental collaboration where participants can’t be in the same room.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s05_p04">Technical components generally necessary for AR include a CPU (central processing unit), a camera, and accelerometer and GPS (global positioning system)—all things that are present in the conveniently sized mobile phone (especially smartphones). It’s no wonder that AR through mobile phones presents such exciting possibilities for communicating with people.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s05_s03_p01">AR is quite new and still has a long way to go. Barriers like costs in development have held it back, but with smartphones becoming more common, potential for AR applications is increasing as well. There has been discussion, for example, of the possibility that AR applications could not only superimpose graphics but also perhaps remove real objects from view through mobile cameras (by recreating a background out of the colors surrounding a desk lamp, for example, and then covering the lamp).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s05_s03_p02">Going forward, there are a number of challenges AR faces, investment in development and the potential for serous privacy concerns being the most notable. The images below illustrate what is possible when the realms of social media, identity recognition, and geographical location are combined—both exciting and scary stuff.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Planning to Go Mobile</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p01">There is no doubt that the mobile phone presents an enticing marketing opportunity and market space. Early movers in the mobile space have seen remarkable success, and some have made remarkable amounts of money. How do you prepare to go mobile?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p02">First, as with any marketing activity, planning and setting goals are key. What do you want your campaign to achieve? How can mobile be used to help you achieve those goals?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p03">Second, you need to consider your audience. Who do you need to reach? What sort of phones and features of their phones do they have and, importantly, use? iPhone applications may be more fun to develop than a campaign based on SMS, but iPhone applications can only reach iPhone users, while SMS can reach almost everyone who has a mobile phone. (Many developers of iPhone apps do, however, make similar or identical apps for other smartphones.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p04">Third, how will users actually access your campaign? Do you need permission first to send them messages, or will you be advertising or marketing the campaign to get them to access it?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p05">You also need to choose partners for your campaign for their technology and distribution networks and, of course, for their expertise. Ensure that the partners you choose adhere to your country’s mobile ethics and standards code, as well as those of your brand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s06_p06">Lastly, you need to determine how mobile marketing fits into your overall marketing strategy. Will mobile marketing be complementing existing services and campaigns, or will you be developing campaigns, goods, and services specifically for the mobile environment?</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Pros and Cons</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s07_p01">The mobile phone has many benefits (there are those seven unique features after all) but comes with its own challenges. The reach of the mobile phone alone makes it a very attractive marketing channel.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s07_p02">Many mobile marketing mediums need little audience education, but marketers need to be aware of creating more complicated campaigns and applications. If there is an extensive education process required in order for a campaign to succeed, it probably needs to be rethought.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s06_s07_p03">Because the mobile phone is so personal, permission and privacy need to be at the foundation of any mobile campaign. Unlike an e-mail or Web pages where there is space available on screen to explain privacy and permission, there is very little real estate on the mobile phone to do so. Ensure that you have very clear permission to market to the phone numbers on your database and that it is easy for users to opt out of receiving your messages.</p>

                <li>Mobile phones have different operating systems. There are also multiple ways for a device to connect with the Internet.</li>
                <li>Mobile devices can access the Internet via WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) sites or more sophisticated HTML (hypertext markup language) browsers. However, the HTML browsers are pared-down versions as mobile devices have low memory and low bandwidth.</li>
                <li>Webmasters can take some best practices into consideration for making Web sites appropriate for mobile browsing.</li>
                <li>2D (two-dimensional) bar codes, also known as tags, are another way for marketers to deliver their message to a user’s phone.</li>
                <li>Mobile search is becoming increasingly more important. Natural and paid search also applies here.</li>
                <li>Mobile apps are another eMarketing channel that is becoming increasingly important.</li>
                <li>Augmented reality (AR) is a variation of virtual reality that superimposes graphics into “reality.”</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s07_p01">South Africa’s mobile community grossly outweighs the number of people with access to the Internet, so it was up to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi’s digital department, AtPlay, to find a way to bring the interactive Peugeot Break Free campaign to a Web and mobile market.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s07_p02">The mobile chat network, MXit, has nine million users in the country and was the perfect portal to seed a comprehensive campaign—along with support across other social networks such as Facebook and MySpace. Competing with the Toyota Aygo and Citroen C1, which were launched around the same time, Peugeot’s 107 campaign reached out to the younger, style-conscious generation on MXit who may not be buying cars just yet but are influential with their car-purchasing parents.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s07_p03">The first step was to create a branded splash screen and Peugeot 107 profile. The 107 MXit profile fed information about the campaign from the Web site directly to the users—some content being hidden for the only the keenest eye to spot.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s07_p04">Templates of the car allowed the public to design their dream Peugeot 107, and it was up to the voters to pick the winner. The finalists were all sent t-shirts featuring a unique Semacode, or bar-coded URL (uniform resource locator) address, to give to their friends and family. Taking a photo of the encrypted image with a Semacode-enabled camera phone meant that the users could navigate directly to the voting page via their mobile device.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch15_s07_p05">MXit background themes, or “skinz,” based on the finalists’ designs were also specially created, and seven thousand were downloaded within an hour.</p>
