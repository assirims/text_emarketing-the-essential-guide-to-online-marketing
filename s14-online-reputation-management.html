        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p01">If Dell were really smart, they’d hire me (yes, me) to come to them and teach them about blogs, about how their customers now have a voice; about how their customers are a community—a community often in revolt; about how they could find out what their customers really think; about how they could fix their customers’ problems before they become revolts; about how they could become a better company with the help of their customers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p03">Online <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversations</a><span class="glossdef">A bidirectional discussion between either individuals or a brand and its stakeholders in an online environment such as social media.</span></span> are taking place all the time: about politics, about Britney Spears, about a pet dog, about nearly anything. People everywhere are engaging in and creating blogs, videos, mashups, and more. It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer-generated media (CGM)</a><span class="glossdef">Another term for social media—the media that are published, created, and shared by individuals on the Internet, such as blogs, images, and video.</span></span>, and it’s big news for any company or personality today.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p04">We’ve learned about the tools of social media and the importance of word of mouth when it comes to viral marketing. Consumers trust each other, and search engines find that trust very relevant. Increasingly, CGM is showing up in the top results of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine results pages (SERPs)</a><span class="glossdef">What is seen on a search engine when a search is performed.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p05">The use of social media has equipped consumers with a voice, a platform, and the ability to amplify their views. The connected nature of the Internet makes these views easy to share, and the accessibility of social media tools makes it easy for other consumers to respond. Whether positive, negative, or just slightly off center, consumers are making their views known and brands are taking heed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p06">Added to this is the rising prevalence of CGM in search results, particularly with the recent integration of Twitter into search results and Google’s Social Search. Entries that companies have no control over are ranking highly in brand search results. A Google search on “brand name + complaints” will display a whole lot more CGM.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p07">A company’s reputation can make a difference to its bottom line. Companies that listen to and engage with their customers and appear honest and transparent can benefit from a growing fan base of loyal customers who can then turn into passionate spokespeople. Companies who ignore the voices of their customers will see diminishing loyalty and a growing resentment among the vocal online consumers. So much so that the recent King III report on corporate governance requires that stakeholder reputation is managed in order for compliance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn10_001">“King III Report,” PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pwc.com/za/en/king3/index.jhtml">http://www.pwc.com/za/en/king3/index.jhtml</a> (accessed June 23, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p08">Research by Edelman in 2008 found that 54 percent of individuals trusted fellow consumers ahead of any other source; similarly, Nielsen’s “Trust in Advertising” found that 78 percent of people trust the recommendations of others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn10_002">“Edelman Trust Barometer 2008,” Edelman, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.edelman.com/TRUST/2008/TrustBarometer08_FINAL.pdf">http://www.edelman.com/TRUST/2008/TrustBarometer08_FINAL.pdf</a> (accessed June 22, 2010); “Trust in Advertising: A Global Nielsen Consumer Report,” Nielsen, October 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://asiapacific.acnielsen.com/site/documents/TrustinAdvertisingOct07.pdf">http://asiapacific.acnielsen.com/site/documents/TrustinAdvertisingOct07.pdf</a> (accessed June 22, 2010).</span> Companies and individuals need to listen to what is being said about them and learn how to respond to and engage with their consumers in this world of shifting power.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p02">In terms of the company, one can track the following:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p04">In terms of competitors, one can track the following:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l04">
            <li>Apple</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p06">For its industry, Apple might use the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_l05">
            <li>Consumer Electronics Show Las Vegas</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p08">It is also important to track common misspellings, all related companies, and all related Web sites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p09">Tracking the names of people key to a company can highlight potential brand attacks or can demonstrate new areas of outreach for a company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p10">Brand names, employee names, product names, and even competitor names are not unique. To avoid monitoring too much, identify keywords that will indicate that a post has nothing to do with your company and negative match that keyword in your searches.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s02_s02_p11">For example, “apple” could refer to a consumer electronics company, or it could appear in a post about the health benefits of fruit. Finding keywords that will indicate context can help save time. So you could negative match words like “fruit,” “tasty,” and “Granny Smith.”</p>

This includes all Web sites and domains owned by a company, all blogs maintained by employees (whether company blogs or personal blogs), and all blogs maintained by former employees. An audit should give an idea of the content that is available to the public and what that content is saying.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p02">With regular RSS updates declaring that selected keywords have been used in some form of social media, a growing list is being created of mentions surrounding a brand. Now what?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p03">Even in the democratized world of the Internet, not all mentions are equal. They vary in terms of positivity or negativity and influence. Not all mentions require action from a company, but some require drastic measures to be taken. But all, no matter how quiet or how loud, are an indication of consumer sentiment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p04">Whether a post is positive, negative, or indifferent can be quickly assessed by reading it. Influence can be a little harder to establish.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p05">Indicators such as traffic, links, and subscriber numbers can all assist in assessing the influence of a blog. There are also services such as Social Meter (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialmeter.com">http://www.socialmeter.com</a>) that will show an entered URL’s audience and reach.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p06">However, statements, particularly inflammatory ones, should still be monitored, as traffic can increase substantially and quickly online.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p07">Influence can also assist in establishing the credibility of the author. Factors that can indicate credibility include the size of the blog’s audience, the frequency of posts, and the age of the blog. From this, metrics such as credibility, sentiment, and media distribution can be extrapolated. Furthermore, metrics such as reputation scores and volume of conversation provide insight into the health of a brand and the success of marketing and communication campaigns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p08">The source should also be looked at: is the mention a news item or a tag on a photo from someone’s holiday? The first would be a credible source, but the second would not be high in credibility.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p09">To be able to monitor reputation over time, it can be a good idea to aggregate the information into a spreadsheet or database along with the factors mentioned previously. It is necessary to determine what is important to the reputation of the company you are monitoring and perhaps adapt factors accordingly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s03_p10">Your database might look something like this:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_p01">The best way to show that you are listening is by engaging. Online, there are many channels available to companies to respond to the conversation and to become an active participant in it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_p02">What if everything being said is nice?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_p03">A fantastic position to be in is that every possible mention that includes your company, its employees, and products is overwhelmingly positive. Well done. However, that does not mean that there is nothing to do. Consumers want to know that a company is listening; it needs to respond. Positive comments should be acknowledged.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_p04">All of these mentions can also indicate new avenues for marketing and growth.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s02_p01">If everything being said is neutral, then it sounds like the company is very boring. As Seth Godin puts it, “safe is risky.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn10_003">Seth Godin, “Safe Is Risky,” Seth Godin’s Blog, October 22, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/10/safe_is_risky.html">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/10/safe_is_risky.html</a> (accessed June 20, 2010).</span> If a company is playing it so safe that no one can be bothered to either send praise or criticism its way, it’s in danger of being forgotten. The next step is no one talking about the company at all.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s03_p01">Negative statements should be seen as an opportunity for growth. Negative statements can be complaints or criticisms, and both should be dealt with.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s03_p02">Complaints are from stakeholders who have had dealings with a company. By complaining, a customer is giving the company the opportunity to make things right and is probably indicating where the company can improve. Usually, the skilled customer service department of a company should deal with complaints.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s03_p03">If a complaint is online, the resolution should be there as well, although you can try to have it taken offline first. Even though the customer service will likely take place either over e-mail or by phone, posting a comment in a blog post, for example, will show the community that the company both listens and responds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Criticism need not necessarily come from customers, but it is important to be aware of it. If a criticism includes false information, it should be corrected. And if the criticism is true, then it should be dealt with as such.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s04_p01">Responding involves recognizing that consumers dictate the channels of communication and that a company needs to go to the consumer, not the other way around.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s04_p02">In South Africa, “vodacom3G” is the name of a Vodacom representative who monitors the forum <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://mybroadband.co.za">http://mybroadband.co.za</a> and resolves complaints and queries and offers assistance.

If you are responding to a blog post, find the writer’s contact details on the blog and e-mail her directly. As a last resort, use the comments to make contact with the blogger.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s04_p05">When responding, be transparent and honest. Remember that e-mails can be reproduced on blogs. At all times, remember that you are engaged in conversation, not dictation.</p>

Influencing and leading the conversation can also have the consequence of there being more results that are led by your company in the SERPs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s05_p02">Companies can also be proactive by purchasing negative name domains, such as http:// www.companynamesucks.com, to prevent angry customers from buying them and having them hit the SERPs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s04_s05_p03">Lastly, take a look at negative brand-name searches on major search engines and consider PPC (pay-per-click) advertising to offer the company’s point of view.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s05_p01">Online reputation management (ORM) should not simply be seen as a tool in the measurement and engagement arsenal. It provides a great deal more insight that can be applied to many other elements of the business to maximize results.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s05_p02">Within the marketing realm, ORM provides key insights into how particular tactics are performing and how it impacts the overall marketing strategy. By measuring how your stakeholders respond to particular activities (be it marketing, communications, or branding) it becomes possible to learn through each campaign and mold the tactic based on empirical data to maximize returns. This provides a great way for both offline and online campaigns to constantly improve and stay relevant to stakeholders’ needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s05_p03">These same outputs can also be shared with other departments, such as human resources (HR), to provide additional ways to impact the internal workings of your company. In HR’s case, a measure might be of how staff view the company itself.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s05_p04">Similarly, these insights can be applied to the overall business strategy to assist both with data collection and providing early insights on competitor and environmental changes that may drive strategic decision making. The Internet is the largest focus group, and if it’s looked at from a market research perspective, there is a huge opportunity to apply “wisdom of the crowd” and evolve business to be more aligned with your stakeholders’ needs.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 1: Humility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s02_p01">Before you can recover from an online brand attack, you have to be aware that your brand can be attacked, no matter how big it is or how untouchable it may seem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 2: Listen</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s03_p01">Once you have a clear understanding of the scope of the possible effects of an online attack and are committed to maintaining a good reputation online, you’re halfway there. Next you’ve got to understand how the process of consumer complaints has evolved. Use this understanding to guide your actions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 3: Act Immediately</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s04_p01">One of the easiest ways to solve the majority of brand attacks is to respond quickly. A brand that shows it is listening and does indeed care will go far when it comes to ensuring a solid online reputation. A conscious reaction is the only way forward—that is, acknowledging what has been said and reacting accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 4: If What They’re Saying Is False…</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s05_p01">If the mention of your brand is factually incorrect, in a friendly tone, send the blogger (90 percent of the time it will be a blogger) evidence that they are wrong, ask for removal or retraction of the entry, and offer to keep them informed of future news. If no action is taken by the blog author, then add a comment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 5: If What They’re Saying Is True…</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s06_p01">If it is true, learn from the “Dell Hell” phenomenon, a term coined from the situation in which a blogger wrote about his bad experience with computer maker Dell. Dell failed to respond, and the negative word spread—resulting in insurmountable damage for the company. If the mention is negative but true, then tell your side of the story and try as hard as you can to take it offline.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s06_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s06_p02">On January 22, 2009, a story was published on CNN’s iReport claiming that Steve Jobs had had a heart attack. While it was later found out to be a hoax, it had an immediate effect on Apple’s stock price, dropping it by 6.6 percent, amounting to a $5.62 billion loss in market capital.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 6: Keep the Negative Pages out of the Search Engines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s07_p01">Keeping more people from reading negative things about your brand is imperative. What you can do is knock them off the first page of the results with basic SEO topped with some social media page setups such as Squidoo and MySpace or forum posts. Keep adding pages and links until you’ve forced the offending pages out of sight. This tactic doesn’t lack transparency but rather gives consumers the opportunity to view positive mentions of your brand before they come across the negative ones. All brands have negative conversation surrounding them in some form or another.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s08">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 7: Maintain Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s08_p01">If you aren’t an active member of the online community, it will be a little harder to recover from an online attack. If your company doesn’t have a blog, start one. Participate in industry forums and chat rooms. Build genuine credibility as a member of these conversations, and you’ll find that people will have more respect for you and your brand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s09">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rule 8: Engage in the Conversation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s06_s09_p01">Keep your brand in the face of consumers by engaging in the conversation. This could be done by making use of blogs, communicating with customers, and being as open and honest as possible. Engaging in, and leading, the conversation allows you to build an authentic voice.

<span class="title-prefix">11.7</span> Case Study: Four South African Banks</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p01">Using a tool to measure one company’s reputation will give an indication of consumer sentiment, but it is far better to be able to compare that to competitors’ reputations. Using the online reputation management (ORM) monitoring and analyzing tool BrandsEye, the online reputation of four prominent South African banks was measured for the period November 26, 2006, to February 13, 2007.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p02">Banks, and particularly their customer service, generate a lot of conversation, both online and off. BrandsEye was used to monitor mentions of the banks, to filter out duplicate mentions, and to generate a daily reputation score for each bank that could then be measured over time.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p03">Changes in reputation, especially jumps such as the one experienced by Bank 4 just after December 26, can then be correlated to real-world events.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p04">Bank 1 has superior customer service levels, and this is shown in the reputation score. However, toward the end of January, Bank 1 experienced a backlash from local government when attempting to launch a public-service campaign. The offline media coverage was far reaching, loud, and venomous, and within a short while the effects on the bank’s reputation were expected to be seen online. On the contrary, what actually happened was quite surprising. While the ORM tool picked up a number of negative mentions, these were in fact directed at local government for seemingly coercing the bank into withdrawing their campaign.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p05">With a temporary dip in reputation score, the result was that throughout February, Bank 1’s online reputation grew stronger and stronger. Having their hand forced created a sense of public empathy, with the majority of criticism deflected away from the bank itself. Furthermore, when critics of the bank’s withdrawal voiced their opinions, a number of respondents actually jumped to its defense. With an already high online reputation score, not only did Bank 1 survive what could have potentially been a major crisis, but its reputation thrived as a result.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p06">Bank 2, on the other hand, had the lowest reputation score throughout the investigation, although tending to the positive toward the end of the test period. Their poor customer service levels, as perceived by their online customers, were negatively affecting their online reputation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s07_p07">In fact, one of South Africa’s most prolific online forums had an established tradition of using Bank 2 as an example of what was wrong with the industry in general. A comment by one forum member went, “Bank 2 is evil! Evil! Evil! Evil!” The majority of Bank 2’s negative mentions originated from this particular forum, and interestingly, where it was criticized, Bank 1 was offered as a suitable alternative.</p>
