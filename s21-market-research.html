<span class="title-prefix">18.1</span> Introduction</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_p01">While the Internet was developed as a military project, the World Wide Web was developed as a tool for academics to allow information to be shared freely. This foundation of the Web as an information tool has had profound effects on the markets we transact in.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_p02">Consider that consumers are able to research companies and products easily, gathering information to compare prices and service with a few clicks of the mouse. Consumers are also able to share likes and dislikes easily, whether that information is shared with companies or with friends.</p>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_f01">

        <p class="para">Services such as PriceRunner allow consumers to research product prices.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_p03">Likewise, the Web has an impact on market research. Its foundations in academia make it ideal for secondary research, with reports and data filed, indexed, and available via a few savvy searches. Technology can also be used to easily, and accurately, conduct surveys. The connected nature of the Web also makes it possible to record data about consumers’ online habits.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_p04">For example, when researching the penetration of broadband in a particular market, a few Web searches will reveal plenty of sources that can be compared and verified. If a company wants to gauge the demographics of visitors to its Web site, an online survey may be offered to Web site visitors. Third, online reputation management tools allow companies to track consumer sentiment expressed online.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Market Research?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p01">Market research is a process that aids business decisions. It involves systematically gathering, recording, and analyzing data and information about customers, competitors, and the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p02">Research can be based on primary data and information or secondary data and information. Primary research is conducted when data or information is gathered for a particular product or hypothesis. This is where information does not exist already or is not accessible and so needs to be specifically collected from consumers or businesses. Surveys, focus groups, research panels, and research communities can all be used when conducting primary market research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p03">Secondary research uses existing, published data and research as a source of research. It can be more cost effective than conducting primary research, and the Internet opens a wealth of resources for conducting this research. However, the data would have originally been collected for solving problems other than the one at hand, so they might not be sufficiently specific. That being said, secondary research can be useful in identifying problems to be investigated through primary research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p04">Research can also be classified as qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative research can be classified as exploratory. Qualitative research aids in identifying potential hypotheses, whereas quantitative research puts hard numbers behind these hypotheses. Qualitative research seeks to find out what potential consumer perceptions and feelings exist around a given subject. This research can often be used to advise the design of quantitative research, which relies on numerical data to demonstrate statistically significant outcomes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p05">The Internet is a useful tool for both primary and secondary research and can be used to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. In fact, the communities on the Web can be viewed as one large focus group, regularly and willingly sharing their opinions on products, markets, and companies. Today, organizations transacting online have a wealth of research information freely available to them, as well as sophisticated tools for gathering further data.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s01_s02_p06">Market research should produce information that leads to actions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p01">Quantitative research gathers data that can be statistically analyzed to determine results. Data must be formally gathered and should be collected to test a hypothesis as opposed to determine a hypothesis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Qualitative data</a><span class="glossdef">Data that can be observed but not measured. Deal with descriptions.</span></span> can be more difficult to quantify. Typically, because base sizes are smaller and not necessarily representative of the market under investigation (as it can be more expensive and time consuming to gather and analyze the data), qualitative data cannot be taken as quantified. They are, however, valuable in aiding a researcher in interpreting the market perspective. It is possible to combine approaches, producing data that can be used both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p03">With larger sample sizes, qualitative data may be analyzed quantitatively.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p04">For example, in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online reputation management (ORM)</a><span class="glossdef">The understanding and influencing of the perception of an entity online. This entails ensuring that you know what is being said about you and that you are leading the conversation.</span></span>, tools exist that can track brand-name mentions. These data can then be analyzed qualitatively, where researchers can examine the mentions and use their judgment to determine sentiment, or quantitatively, where mentions can be assigned numeric values across a range of categories that are used to generate a reputation score, such as BrandsEye’s online reputation algorithm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_p05">When both qualitative and quantitative research are used, usually qualitative research takes place first to get an idea of the issues to be aware of, and then quantitative research tests the theories put forward in qualitative research.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s02_s02_s02_p01">Research panels and research communities are two means for conducting research. Whereas research panels are primarily used when conducting qualitative research, research communities primarily provide <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quantitative data</a><span class="glossdef">Data that can be measured or defined.

The Internet comes to the fore when considering research communities, as social media such as social networks and blogs already provide the framework for people to connect and interact with each other. Most panels, whether online or offline, are not about member-to-member interaction. Research panels seek to address the “what” using surveys to gather quantitative data. Research communities primarily use discussions, driven online by blogs and other media sharing communities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p01">Market research based on secondary resources uses data that already exist for analysis. This includes both internal data and external data and is useful for exploring the market and marketing problems that exist.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p02">Research based on secondary data should precede primary data research. It should be used in establishing the context and parameters for primary research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p03">Uses of secondary data include the following:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p04">Companies that transact online have a wealth of data that can be mined that exist due to the nature of the Internet. Every action that is performed on the company Web site is recorded in the server logs for the Web site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p05">Customer communications are also a source of data that can be used, particularly communications with a customer service department.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p06">Social networks, blogs, and other forms of social media have emerged as forums where consumers discuss their likes and dislikes, and customers can be particularly vocal about companies and products. These data can, and should, be tracked and monitored to establish consumer sentiment. If a community is established for research purposes, this should be considered primary data, but using social media to research existing sentiments is considered secondary research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s02_p07">The Internet is an ideal starting point for conducting secondary research based on published data and findings. But with so much information out there, it can be a daunting task to find reliable resources.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s03_p01">Primary research involves gathering data for a specific research task. It is based on data that have not been gathered beforehand. Primary research can be either qualitative or quantitative.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s03_p02">Primary research can be used to explore a market and can help develop the hypotheses or research questions that must be answered by further research. Generally, qualitative data are gathered at this stage. For example, online research communities can be used to identify consumer needs that are not being met and brainstorm possible solutions. Further quantitative research can investigate what proportion of consumers share these problems and which potential solutions best meet those needs.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Online Research Communities</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s03_s03_s02_p01">Although online communities are a valuable resource for secondary research, communities can also provide primary data. General Motors’ Fast Lane blog is an example of an online research community that aids in the gathering of research data. The blog can be used as a means to elicit feedback on a particular research problem. This is qualitative data that can aid the company in exploring its research problem further.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_p02">Developing technology also allows for sophisticated and user-friendly surveys to be compiled. For example, as opposed to indicating impressions on a sliding scale, respondents can indicate emotional response.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_p01">The success of a survey in gathering useful data is largely determined by the design of the survey, and particularly by the questions that are asked.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p02">According to SurveyMonkey, the ways in which the surveys are administered play a role in response rates for surveys, and these can be relative:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p03">Response rates can be improved by offering respondents an incentive for completing the survey, such as a chance at winning a grand prize, a lower priced incentive for every respondent, or even the knowledge that they are improving a product or service that they care about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s02_s04_p04">There is a train of thought that paying incentives is not always a good thing. Among less affluent or educated respondents it may predispose them to feel that they need to give so-called good or correct answers that may bias your results. Alternatively you may attract respondents who are in it just for the reward. One approach could be to run the survey with no incentive with the option to offer one if responses are limited.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_p01">As with all things eMarketing, careful planning goes a long way to determining success. As market research can be an expensive project, it is important that planning helps to determine the cost versus the benefit of the research. Qualitative research and secondary research are critical steps in determining whether a larger-scale research project is called for.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_p02">Bear in mind that many tasks that fall under the umbrella of research should be ongoing requirements of eMarketing activities, such as conversion testing and optimizing and online reputation management. Polls and small surveys can also be conducted regularly, and nonintrusively, among visitors to your Web site.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s02_p01">Secondary research can be used to give background and context to the business problem and the context in which the problem can be solved. It should also be used to determine alternative strategies for solving the problem, which can be evaluated through research. Qualitative research, particularly using established online research communities, can also help in determining what the business problems are that need to be solved. Ultimately, determine what are the actions you will be considering after the research is completed and what insights are required to make a decision on those actions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s03_p01">You do not need to survey the entire population of your target market.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s04_p01">The Internet provides a multitude of channels for gathering data. Surveys can be conducted online or via e-mail. Online research panels and online research communities can all be used for gathering data. Web analytics can also be used to collect data, but this is a passive form of data collection. Determine what will provide you with the information you need to make decisions. Be sure to think about whether your research calls for qualitative or quantitative data as this determines the methodology as well.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s05_p01">Keep the survey and questions simple, and ensure that the length of the survey does not overwhelm respondents. A variety of questions can be used to make sure that the survey is not repetitive.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s03_s05_p02">Be sure when creating the questions that you keep your goals in mind: don’t be tempted to try to collect too much data, or you will likely overwhelm respondents.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p01">With all research, there is a given amount of error that needs to be dealt with. Errors may result from the interviewers administering a questionnaire (and possibly leading the respondents) to the design and wording of the questionnaire itself, sample errors, and respondent errors. Using the Internet to administer surveys and questionnaires removes the bias that may arise from an interviewer. However, with no interviewer to explain questions, there is potential for greater respondent error. This is why survey design is so important and why it is crucial to test and run pilots of the survey before going live.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Respondent error</a><span class="glossdef">An error that occurs when respondents become desensitized to the research process.</span></span> also arises when respondents become too used to the survey process. There is the possibility of respondents becoming desensitized. There is even a growing trend of professional survey takers, especially where there is an incentive involved. The general industry standard is to limit respondents to being interviewed once every six months.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sample error</a><span class="glossdef">An inaccuracy in the results of research that occurs when a population sample is used to explain the behavior of the total population.</span></span> is a fact of market research. Some people are just not interested in, nor will ever be interested in, taking part in surveys. Are these people fundamentally different, with different purchasing behavior, from those who do? Is there a way of finding out? To some extent, Web analytics, which tracks the behavior of all visitors to your Web site, can be useful in determining the answer to this question.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s04_p04">When conducting any survey, it is crucial to understand who is in the target universe and what the best way to reach that target universe is. Web surveys exclude elements of the population, due to access or ability. It is vital to determine if this is acceptable to the survey and to use other means of capturing data if it is not.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s05_p01">Regular research is an important aspect of the growth strategy of any business, but it can be tough to justify the budget necessary for research without knowing the benefit to the business. Conducting research can cost little more than the time of someone who works for a company, depending on the skills base of employees, or it can be an expensive exercise involving external experts. Deciding where your business needs are on the investment scale depends on the depth of the research required and what the expected growth will be for the business. When embarking on a research initiative, the cost to benefit ratio should be determined.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s04_s05_p02">Testing should be an ongoing feature of any eMarketing activity.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p01">BrandsEye (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.brandseye.com">http://www.brandseye.com</a>) is an online reputation management tool that was launched in March 2008. It scours the Internet in near real-time for mentions of specific keywords and then develops a reputation score based on those mentions. Online reputation-monitoring tools are fairly new to the online scene, which meant that business and technical developments following the launch of BrandsEye relied heavily on feedback from users, and potential users, of the system.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p02">BrandsEye’s primary target is large businesses, and the service and pricing options on launch reflected this. Of course, one of the businesses that the tool has been tracking from day one is BrandsEye itself. While mentions are quantitatively analyzed to generate a reputation score, they can all be qualitatively analyzed to determine sentiment from specific individuals and to highlight product features that may be improved.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p03">BrandsEye requires a rapid rate of development to ensure its product remains competitive. With a relatively small number of vocal individuals discussing its industry online, BrandsEye decided that traditional, and expensive, focus groups and surveys were out. These could instead be replaced by real-time analysis and one-to-one consumer engagement. BrandsEye also realized that in the relatively new field of online reputation measurement and management, it was important to have online evangelists on board in order to, over time, heighten brand awareness among its big-business target market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p04">In the week following its launch there were over 120 conversations about BrandsEye from many smaller companies and individuals. They loved the service but found the price prohibitive. Over the next three months more than three hundred unique conversations were tracked, with important outcomes for BrandsEye’s product offering.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p05">An example comment that represented a common theme was “BrandsEye Online Reputation Management for Big Business ONLY.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn17_002">Nic Haralambous, “BrandsEye Online Reputation Management for Big Business ONLY,” nh [dot] com, March 13, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://nicharalambous.com/2008/03/13/brandseye-online-reputation-management-for-big-business-only">http://nicharalambous.com/2008/03/13/brandseye-online-reputation-management-for-big-business-only</a> (accessed June 20, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p06">While big business sales continued to grow, BrandsEye realized that the more people who engage with its product, the more feedback it could collect and, with that, increase the rate of market-driven development. Second, of doing this that it realize that there was a considerable untapped market among small businesses and individuals.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p07">Instead of conducting focus groups, BrandsEye found that one already existed! Using feedback from early commenters, BrandsEye developed a small business and blogger product. The service was priced to be accessible to this target market at only $1 a month.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch17_s05_p08">Since the launch of the new service, BrandsEye has grown considerably. Several new features have been added in direct response to market needs. BrandsEye has seen an over 800 percent turnover increase for its big-business offering and a 2,500 percent increase in the overall number of accounts. It just took a little research.</p>
