        <h2 class="title editable block">Technical Obstacles</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s08_s02_p01">The nature of a lot of display advertising is intrusive, so <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pop-up blockers</a><span class="glossdef">Any software or application that disables pop-ups on a Web browser.</span></span> can often prevent ads from being served as they were intended by the advertisers. Most browsers now block <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pop-ups</a><span class="glossdef">Unrequested window that opens on top of the currently viewed window.</span></span>. There are also extensions available for the Firefox browser, such as Adblock Plus, that will block advertising on Web pages. Technologically savvy consumers are increasingly using these methods to limit the advertising that they see.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s08_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Connection Speed</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s08_s03_p01">Bandwidth can also be an issue, although this is a shrinking problem. However, campaigns should be planned around demographics in determining the richness (and investment) of interaction. For example, heart disease medication is likely to appeal to an older community with less money and slower connection speeds.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising Fatigue</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s08_s04_p01">Consumers are suffering from <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advertising fatigue</a><span class="glossdef">The stage at which consumers ignore advertising because there is too much of it and it becomes repetitive.</span></span>, so while new technologies can provide great results, as soon as the market moves mainstream, it can get saturated. Consumers are increasingly ignoring advertisements.</p>
