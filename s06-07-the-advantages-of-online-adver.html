        <h2 class="title editable block">Banner Ads and Their Similarity to Traditional Media</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p01">eMarketers regularly bemoan the fact that it’s often difficult to educate the market about the value of Internet marketing techniques. Traditional buyers of advertising have been conditioned in a certain fashion and have come to understand advertising in a certain way.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p02">Banner advertising goes a long way toward bridging the advertising divide. Online ads have a set size, they can look very similar to print ads, and they occupy a particular bit of real estate in a publication with a particular number of eyeballs looking at it. They’re easy to understand, and they do the things buyers expect advertising to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_p03">Bottom line: if done correctly, online advertising builds brand awareness and increases sales!</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Images: Display Can Offer a Rich, Brand-Building Experience</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s02_p01">Some campaigns are better suited to having images rather than the plain text of a PPC (pay-per-click) campaign (although recently PPC image and video ads have been introduced in the United States). Consider the following methods for campaigns:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promoting travel packages</strong>. What stirs more emotion—an image of a tropical paradise or the words “tropical paradise”?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Building a brand within a specific sphere</strong>. Use banner advertising to brand the Web sites of every major player in that niche.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Running a competition</strong>. Keep the target market’s eye on the prize.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Launching an exciting new sports car with a</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">call to action</a><span class="glossdef">A phrase written to motivate the reader to take action (e.g., “sign up for our newsletter,” “make car rental reservations today”).</span></span>. A possible call to action might be“Test drive it now”—or interactive rich media that highlight all the exciting new features as a user mouses over specific parts of the car on the image.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Digital shadowing</strong>. Using banner advertisements that shadow the above-the-fold activity to drive the message both on- and offline.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Interactivity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03_p01">Since banners can contain rich media, they offer levels of interaction that other forms of advertising cannot achieve. It allows your target market not only to see your banner but also to play with it. Interaction builds a bond and improves the chances of the consumer remembering your brand tomorrow. Cognitive learning is a powerful outcome of interactive display advertising.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03_p02">Animations, games, video, Flash—modern online advertising is able to bring together a number of other online marketing tactics:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Microsites</strong>. A few years ago, Flash microsites were all the rage; now the same functionality can exist right within the ad. This includes filling in a form or playing a game within the ad—no need to be taken to a separate page.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Viral marketing</strong>. Clever viral marketing games or “send to a friend” functionality can be accessed all from within the ad.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Video</strong>. Viewers can check out video previews or trailers from within the ad.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Measurability and Data Gathering</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s04_p01">Banner ads, like all eMarketing tactics, are measurable. Tracking click-through rates, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">click tracking</a><span class="glossdef">Using scripts to track clicks into and out of a Web site. Can also be used to shield a link from being picked up as a back link to another site.</span></span>, gives you an idea of exactly how many people are responding to your call to action. Some publishers even have the ability to do postclick tracking—that is, you can track the user all the way to a sale if that is the purpose of the advertisement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch03_s07_s02_s04_p02">An Online Publishers Association (OPA) study in 2007 revealed that of the 80 percent of viewers that were reported to have watched a video ad online, 52 percent took some action, including checking out a Web site (31 percent), searching for more information (22 percent), going into a store (15 percent), or actually making a purchase (12 percent).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn03_005">Online Publishers Association Europe, “Online Publishers Association Unveils Online Video Advertising Effectiveness Study,” June 6, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://recette.opa-europe.org/spip.php?article207">http://recette.opa-europe.org/spip.php?article207</a> (accessed June 17, 2010).</span></p>
