    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p01">When it comes to writing copy on the Internet, content is king. The copy on a Web page is a hardworking multitasker. It needs to provide information to visitors, engage with them, and lead them to perform a desired action—all while conveying brand ethos. It also needs to provide context and relevance to search engines. And it needs to achieve all this fluidly without appearing to be trying too hard.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p02">Copywriting is a fundamental element of effective online marketing. Whether writing an e-mail to a colleague or PPC (pay-per-click) advertisements for a new product launch, learning how to write effective online copy will make you a better communicator.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p03">Online copywriting entails everything from the copy of Web site pages, to the content of an e-mail, and all written elements in between. From eight-hundred-word WebPR (Web public relations) articles to three-line PPC advertisements, if it’s being read on a screen, it’s online copy. Ultimately, you are writing on the Web to meet business objectives, so it is important to never sway from the strategic element and potential of your online copy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch13_s01_p04">Focus on writing in a strategic, persuasive, compelling manner.</p>
