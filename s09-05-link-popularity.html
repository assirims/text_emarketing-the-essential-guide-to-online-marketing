    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p01">Links are a vital part of how the Internet works. The purpose of a link is to allow a user to go from one Web page to another. Search engines, doing their best to mimic the behavior of humans, also follow links.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p02">Besides allowing search engine spiders to find Web sites, links are also a way of validating relevance and indicating importance. When one page links to another, it is as if that page is voting or vouching for the destination page. Generally, the more votes a Web site receives, the more trusted it becomes, the more important it is deemed, and the better it will rank on search engines.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p03">Links help send signals of trust. Signals of trust can only come from a third-party source. Few people will trust someone who says, “Don’t worry, you can trust me” unless someone else, who is already trusted says, “Don’t worry, I know him well. You can trust him.” It is the same with links and search engines. Trusted sites can transfer trust to unknown sites via links.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_p04">Links help validate relevance. Text links, by their very nature, contain text (thank you, Captain Obvious). The text that makes up the link can help validate relevance. A link like “Cape Town hotel” sends the message that says, “You can trust that the destination site is relevant to the term ‘Cape Town hotel.’” If the destination Web page has already used content to send a signal of relevance, the link simply validates that signal.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Does a Link Look Like?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p01">Here is the hypertext markup language (HTML) code for a link:</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p02">&lt;a href=“http://www.targeturl.com/targetpage.htm”&gt;Anchor Text&lt;/a&gt;</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p03">“http://www.targeturl.com/targetpage.htm” is the page that the link leads to. “Anchor Text” is the text that forms the link.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p04">The link sends a signal that the target URL (uniform resource locator) is important for the subject of the anchor text.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p05">Why might a site want to tell the search engine not to follow a link?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p06">There is a lot more information that can be included in this anatomy, such as instructions telling the search engine not to follow the link or instructions to the browser as to whether the link should open in a new window or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p07">&lt;a href=http://www.targeturl.com/targetpage.htm rel=“<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nofollow</a><span class="glossdef">Can be included in links when you don’t want to vouch for the target URL (uniform resource locator).

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s02_p08">The instruction rel=“nofollow” can be included in links when you don’t want to vouch for the target URL. Search engines do not count nofollow links for ranking purposes. It was initially introduced by Google to try to combat comment spam.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Not All Links Are Created Equal</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p01">Of course, not all links are equal. Some sites are more trusted than others. So if they are more trusted, then links from those sites are worth more. Likewise, some sites are more relevant than others to specific terms. The more relevant a site, the more value is transferred by the link. Well-known and established news sites, government sites (.gov), and university domains (.edu) are examples of sites from which links can carry more weight.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p02">Search algorithms also consider relationships between linked sites. By analyzing various things, the engines try to determine if the links are natural links or if they are manipulative, artificial links created solely for ranking purposes. Manipulated links are worth very little compared to natural links and may lead to a drop in search engine rankings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s03_p03">The search engine algorithm will also determine the relevancy of the referring Web site to the site being linked to. The more relevant the sites are to each other, the better.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Does a Web Site Get More Links?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_p01">With links playing such a vital role in search engine rankings and traffic for a Web site, everyone wants more of them. The more relevant the referring Web site is to your Web site, the better the link. There are certainly dubious means to generating links, most of which can actually result in being penalized by the search engines. However, here are some ways that ethical and honest Web site owners and marketers (and that’s what you are) go about increasing the number of links to their Web sites.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Excellent, Valuable Content That Others Want to Read</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s02_p01">If people find your site useful, they are more likely to link to it. It is not necessary, nor possible, to try to write content that will appeal to the whole Internet population. Focus on being the best in the industry you are in and in providing value to the members of that community. Make sure that valuable content is themed around your key phrases.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Create Tools and Documents That Others Want to Use</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s03_p01">Interview experts in your field, and host those interviews on your Web site. Think outside the box for quirky, relevant items that people will link to. Calculators are popular tools, and we don’t just mean the ones that add two and two together. If you have a Web site selling diet books, for example, create a tool that helps users calculate their body mass index (BMI) and target weight.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s04_p01">Creating a game that people want to play is a great way to generate links. Make sure that the theme of the game is based on the key phrases for your Web site, so that when others talk about and link to the game, they are using your key phrases!</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Software and Widgets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch06_s05_s04_s05_p01">Widgets, browser extensions, and other useful software that users love to use all help generate links for a Web site. Quirk has released a Firefox extension called SearchStatus that is exceptionally useful to the SEO community and is downloaded thousands of time each month. Each time someone mentions this SEO tool, they link to Quirk.</p>
