        <h3 class="title">Learning Objective</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_l01">
            <li>Understand why tracking and data collection are important to eMarketing.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p01">Currently, there are two main technology approaches for collecting Web analytics data: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">log-file analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Analysis of log records, which shows where visitors are coming from, how often they visit, and their path through the site. When used in conjunction with cookies, this analysis provides much more in-depth information.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">page tagging</a><span class="glossdef">The process of tagging Web pages with embedded JavaScript files.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p02">Log-file analysis software reads the records, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">log files</a><span class="glossdef">Text files created on the server each time a click takes place, capturing all activity on the Web site.</span></span>, on the Web server, which record all clicks that take place on the server. Web servers have always stored all the clicks that take place in a log file, so the software interprets data that have always been available. A new line is written in a log file with each new request. For example, clicking on a link, an Ajax call, or submitting a form will each result in a new line being written.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p03">Page tagging, on the other hand, sends information to a third-party server, where statistics can be generated. The browser executes JavaScript code that communicates with the tracking software, creating <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">page tags</a><span class="glossdef">JavaScript files embedded on a Web page and executed by the browser.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p04">Pixel tracking can be used to track e-mail campaigns. Here, a tiny, transparent pixel is placed in the e-mail. When you load the images in the e-mail, you will also load the tiny image that tracks your activity.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_p05">Caching is when a browser stores some of the information for a Web page so it can retrieve the page more quickly when you return to it. If a Web page is cached by your browser, when you look at the page again, it will not send a request to the Web server. This means that that particular visit will not show in the log files. Page tagging, however, would capture this visit. But some browsers do not support JavaScript, and page tagging would not capture those visits. This is why there is often a discrepancy in the numbers reported by the two services.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Log-File Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02_p01">In terms of log-file analysis, you should know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Log files are normally produced by Web servers, so the raw data are readily available. Page tagging, however, requires changes to the Web site.</li>
            <li>Log files are very accurate—they record every click. Page tagging can be less accurate. If a user’s browser does not support JavaScript, for example, no information will be captured.</li>
            <li>Log files are in a standard format, so it is possible to switch vendors and still be able to analyze historical data. Page tagging is proprietary to each vendor, so switching can mean losing historical data.</li>
            <li>Log files record visits from search engine spiders—useful for search engine optimization.</li>
            <li>Log files record failed requests, whereas page tagging only shows successful requests.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Page Tagging</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p01">In terms of page tagging, you should know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>JavaScript makes it easier to capture more information (e.g., products purchased or screen size of a user’s browser). You can use log-file analysis to capture this information, but it will involve modifying the URLs (uniform resource locators).</li>
            <li>Page tagging can report on events, such as interactions with a Flash movie, that log-file analysis cannot.</li>
            <li>Page tagging can be used by companies that do not run their own Web servers.</li>
            <li>Page tagging service providers usually offer a greater level of support. This is because it is a third-party service, whereas log-file analysis software is often managed in-house.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Because of the different methods of collecting data, the raw figures produced by the two services will differ. Sometimes, both are used to analyze a Web site. However, raw figures not matching up should not be a problem. It is through interpreting these figures that you will be able to understand how effective your eMarketing efforts are.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_p03">Web site analytics packages can be used to measure most, if not all, eMarketing campaigns. Web site analysis should always account for the various campaigns being run. For example, generating high traffic volumes by employing various eMarketing tactics like SEO (search engine optimization), PPC (pay per click), and e-mail marketing can prove to be a pointless and costly exercise if the visitors are leaving your site without achieving one (or more) of your Web site’s goals. Conversion optimization aims to convert as many of a Web site’s visitors as possible into active customers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_s02_p01">There are three types of Web analytics metrics:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s03_s02_l01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_p01">Here are some of the key metrics you will need to get started on Web site analytics:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_l01">

<strong class="emphasis bold">Page</strong>. Unit of content (so downloads and Flash files can be defined as a page).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Page views</strong>. The number of times a page was successfully requested.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visit or session</strong>. An interaction by an individual with a Web site consisting of one or more page views within a specified period of time.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Unique visitors</strong>. The number of individual people visiting the Web site one or more times within a period of time. Each individual is only counted once. Types of visitors can be categorized as follows:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_l02">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">New visitor</strong>. A unique visitor who visits the Web site for the first time ever in the period of time being analyzed.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Repeat visitor</strong>. A unique visitor with two or more visits within the time period being analyzed.</li>
                    <li>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_p02">A repeat visitor may be either a new visitor or a return visitor, depending on the number of times he or she has visited the site within the time period being analyzed.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch14_s03_s04_p03">These are the most basic Web metrics. They tell you how much traffic your Web site is receiving. Looking at repeat and returning visitors can tell you about how your Web site creates loyalty. As well as growing overall visitor numbers, a Web site needs to grow the number of visitors who come back. An exception might be a support Web site—repeat visitors could indicate that the Web site has not been successful in solving the visitor’s problem. Each Web site needs to be analyzed based on its purpose.</p>
