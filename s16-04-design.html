    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_p02">Looks may not matter to search engines, but they go a long way toward assuring visitors of your credibility and turning them into customers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_p03">Every Web site needs to be designed with clear goals (or conversions) in mind. Conversions take many forms and may include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sale</strong>. Where the user purchases a product online using a credit card</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Lead</strong>. Where the user submits contact details and asks for more information</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sign-up</strong>. Where the user opts in for e-mail marketing newsletters</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Download</strong>. Where the user downloads a file from the site</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_p04">Before designing a Web site, research your audience and competitors to determine expectations and common elements to your industry. Mock up every layer of interaction. This means that before any coding begins, there is clear map of how the Web site should work. It’s all about foundations.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Design to Establish Credibility</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_p01">Here are some of the cues that visitors use to determine the credibility of a Web site:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Place phone numbers and addresses</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">above the fold</a><span class="glossdef">All the content that can be seen on a screen without scrolling down.</span></span>. This assures the visitor that there is a real person behind the Web site and that he or she is in easy reach.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create an informative and personal “about us</strong>.” Your customers want to see the inner workings of a company and are especially interested in learning more about the head honchos. Include employee pictures or profiles. It puts a face to an organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feature genuine testimonials on each page</strong>. This is a great way to show potential customers what your current customers have to say about your organization. Trust is vital, and this is one way to encourage it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Feature logos of associations and awards</strong>. If you belong to any relevant industry associations or have won any awards, feature them. Not only does this go a long way to establish your credibility, but it will show that you’re at the top of your game and a notch above the competition.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Link to credible third-party references</strong>. This is a way to assert your credibility without tooting your own horn.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep content fresh and updated</strong>. This shows that you are knowledgeable and up to date in your industry.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ensure that your site is free of errors</strong>. Spelling and grammar mistakes are exceptionally unprofessional, and while the large majority of readers may not pick up on them, the one or two who do will question your credibility.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Include a portfolio of past work</strong>. Give your Web site visitors examples of your previous work to show what you are capable of.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s02_p02">Design also affects the accessibility of a Web site. You need to take into account screen resolutions, as designing for the biggest screen available could leave many of your users scrolling across and down to see the Web page. Subtle shading, background colors to text, and fancy fonts can also mean that many users cannot even see your Web site properly.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p01">A cascading style sheet (CSS) is defined by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) as “a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn12_002">“Cascading Style Sheets Home Page,” World Wide Web Consortium, June 3, 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.w3c.org/Style/css">http://www.w3c.org/Style/css</a> (accessed June 23, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p02">In the early days of the Web, designers tended to use tables to lay out content for a Web page, and many Web sites still do so today. However, different browsers, and even different versions of browsers, all support code differently, resulting in Web sites that only work on certain browsers or bulky code needed to cope with all the different versions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p03">The W3C (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>) was created in 1994 and since then has been responsible for specifications and guidelines to promote the evolution of the Web, while ensuring that Web technologies work well together. The Web Standards Project (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webstandards.org">http://www.webstandards.org</a>) launched in 1998 and labeled key guidelines as “Web standards.” Modern browsers should be built to support these standards, which should vastly reduce cross-browser compatibility problems, such as Web sites displaying differently in different browsers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p04">Web standards include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>HTML (hypertext markup language)</li>
            <li>CSS (cascading style sheet)</li>
            <li>XML (extensible markup language)</li>
            <li>XHTML (extensible hypertext markup language)</li>
            <li>DOM (document object model)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p05">CSS is standard layout language. It controls colors, typography, and the size and placement of elements on a Web page. Previously, Web developers have had to create instructions for every page in a Web site. With CSS, a single file can control the appearance of an entire site.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p06">CSS allows designers and developers to separate presentation from content. This has several key benefits:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_l02">
            <li>Sites are easier to maintain and update and are more accessible.</li>
            <li>Content may be updated easily by someone who is not a Web designer or developer.</li>
            <li>Global changes can be applied quickly and easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p07">CSS can also do the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_l03">
            <li>Reduce bandwidth and page-loading times</li>
            <li>Increase cross-browser compatibility</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s03_p08">To see CSS in action, visit <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.csszengarden.com">http://www.csszengarden.com</a>, where you can make a single HTML page look very different, depending on which one of the many designer-contributed style sheets you apply to it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Content Management System</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p01">As the name implies, a content management system (CMS) is used to manage the content of a Web site. If a site is updated frequently and if people other than Web developers need to update the content of a Web site, a CMS is used. Today, many sites are built on a CMS. The CMS can also allow content of a Web site to be updated from any location in the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p02">A CMS can be built specifically for a Web site, and many Web development companies build their own CMS that can be used by their clients. A CMS can also be bought prebuilt, and there are many <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open-source</a><span class="glossdef">Unlike proprietary software, open-source software makes the source code available so that other developers can build applications for or even improve the software.</span></span>, prebuilt CMSs available, some of which are free.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p03">A CMS should be selected with the goals and functions of the Web site in mind. A CMS needs to be able to scale along with the Web site and business that it supports, and not the other way around.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p04">Of course, the CMS selected should result in a Web site that is search engine friendly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p05">Here are some key features to look out for when selecting or building a CMS:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Meta and title tag customization</strong>. The CMS should allow you to enter your own meta tags and fully customize title tags for each page.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">HTML tag customization</strong>. The CMS should allow for full customization of HTML tags, such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nofollow links</a><span class="glossdef">Nofollow is an attribute of a hyperlink, indicating to search engines that the link is not endorsed by the Web site.</span></span>. See <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch06#fwk-105454-ch06">Chapter 6 "Search Engine Optimization"</a> for an explanation of nofollow links.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">URLs</strong>. Instead of using dynamic parameters, the CMS should allow for server-side rewriting of URLs (uniform resource locators). It should allow for the creation of URLs that have the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_l02">
                    <li>Static</li>
                    <li>Rewritable</li>
                    <li>Keyword rich</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customizable navigation</strong>. A good CMS will allow flexibility when it comes to creating the information architecture for a Web site. For the purposes of adding additional content for search engines, a CMS should not require that all content pages be linked to from the home page navigation. This allows content to be added for SEO (search engine optimization) purposes, without adding it to the main navigation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">301 redirect functionality</strong>. It is imperative that a CMS offers the ability to put in place 301 redirects to prevent penalization for duplicate content on different URLs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customizable image naming and alt tags for images</strong>. A good CMS will allow you to create custom alt tags and title attributes for images.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Robots.txt management</strong>. Ensure you are able to customize the robots.txt to your needs, or that this can at least be managed using meta tags.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Content search</strong>. Make sure you are able to include a useful site search.</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="para">Joomla! is an open-source content management system (CMS). Here you can see how the CMS allows you to manage the articles on the Web site.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p06">Be aware when building clean, descriptive, and dynamic URLs from CMS content. Should you use a news heading (“Storm” in this example) as part of your URL (http://www.websitename.com/cape/storm) and someone changes the heading to “Tornado” (http://www.websitename.com/cape/tornado), this will alter the URL and the search engines will index this as a new page, but with the same content as the URL that had the old heading. Bear this in mind before adding dynamic parameters to your URLs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s04_p07">Finally, using a CMS that supports standards compliant HTML and CSS is very important—without it inconsistencies may be rendered across various browsers. It also ensures faster loading time and reduced bandwidth, makes markup easier to maintain, supports SEO efforts, and ensures that every single visitor to a Web site, no matter what browser they are using, will be able to see everything on the site.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s05_p01">As a whole, technology should act only as an enabler. It should never be a site’s main focus. Here are some technical considerations vital for a good Web site.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s05_s05_p01">Form validation is the process whereby the data entered into a form are verified in order to meet certain preset conditions (e.g., ensuring that the name and e-mail address fields are filled in).</p>

Client-side validation can alert a visitor to an incorrectly filled-in form most quickly, but server-side validation is the most accurate. It is also important to have a tool to collect all the failed tests and present appropriate error messages neatly above the form the user is trying to complete. This will ensure that correctly entered data are not lost but repopulated in the form to save time and reduce frustration.</p>

Cookies can be used to maintain sessions, but URL rewriting can be used to compensate for users who do not have cookies activated. This means that as visitors move through a Web site, their session information is stored in a dynamically generated Web address.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch12_s04_s05_s07_p03">Search engine spiders do not support cookies, so many Web sites will attempt URL rewriting to maintain the session as the spider crawls the Web site. However, these URLs are not liked by search engine spiders (as they appear to create a moving target for the robot) and can hinder crawling and indexing. The work-around: use technology to detect if a visitor to the site is a person or a robot, and do not rewrite URLs for the search engine robots.</p>
