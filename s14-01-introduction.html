    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p03">Online <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conversations</a><span class="glossdef">A bidirectional discussion between either individuals or a brand and its stakeholders in an online environment such as social media.</span></span> are taking place all the time: about politics, about Britney Spears, about a pet dog, about nearly anything. People everywhere are engaging in and creating blogs, videos, mashups, and more. It’s called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer-generated media (CGM)</a><span class="glossdef">Another term for social media—the media that are published, created, and shared by individuals on the Internet, such as blogs, images, and video.</span></span>, and it’s big news for any company or personality today.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p04">We’ve learned about the tools of social media and the importance of word of mouth when it comes to viral marketing. Consumers trust each other, and search engines find that trust very relevant. Increasingly, CGM is showing up in the top results of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine results pages (SERPs)</a><span class="glossdef">What is seen on a search engine when a search is performed.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p05">The use of social media has equipped consumers with a voice, a platform, and the ability to amplify their views. The connected nature of the Internet makes these views easy to share, and the accessibility of social media tools makes it easy for other consumers to respond. Whether positive, negative, or just slightly off center, consumers are making their views known and brands are taking heed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p06">Added to this is the rising prevalence of CGM in search results, particularly with the recent integration of Twitter into search results and Google’s Social Search. Entries that companies have no control over are ranking highly in brand search results. A Google search on “brand name + complaints” will display a whole lot more CGM.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p07">A company’s reputation can make a difference to its bottom line. Companies that listen to and engage with their customers and appear honest and transparent can benefit from a growing fan base of loyal customers who can then turn into passionate spokespeople. Companies who ignore the voices of their customers will see diminishing loyalty and a growing resentment among the vocal online consumers. So much so that the recent King III report on corporate governance requires that stakeholder reputation is managed in order for compliance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn10_001">“King III Report,” PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pwc.com/za/en/king3/index.jhtml">http://www.pwc.com/za/en/king3/index.jhtml</a> (accessed June 23, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch10_s01_p08">Research by Edelman in 2008 found that 54 percent of individuals trusted fellow consumers ahead of any other source; similarly, Nielsen’s “Trust in Advertising” found that 78 percent of people trust the recommendations of others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn10_002">“Edelman Trust Barometer 2008,” Edelman, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.edelman.com/TRUST/2008/TrustBarometer08_FINAL.pdf">http://www.edelman.com/TRUST/2008/TrustBarometer08_FINAL.pdf</a> (accessed June 22, 2010); “Trust in Advertising: A Global Nielsen Consumer Report,” Nielsen, October 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://asiapacific.acnielsen.com/site/documents/TrustinAdvertisingOct07.pdf">http://asiapacific.acnielsen.com/site/documents/TrustinAdvertisingOct07.pdf</a> (accessed June 22, 2010).</span> Companies and individuals need to listen to what is being said about them and learn how to respond to and engage with their consumers in this world of shifting power.</p>
