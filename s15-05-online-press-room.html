    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_p01">As the Internet increases the ease of access to information, an essential part of WebPR (Web public relations) is ensuring that pertinent information is easy to access. Making sure that journalists, customers, and investors are able to find all key company information quickly and easily means that you are able to slip into that conversation as a key contributor that much more easily.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_p02">A 2003 <strong class="emphasis bold">Nielsen Norman</strong> study found that when journalists used a corporate Web site to find basic information, they were successful only 73 percent of the time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn11_006">Jakob Nielsen, “PR on Web Sites: Increasing Usability,” Jakob Nielsen’s Alertbox, March 10, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/pr-2nd-study.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/pr-2nd-study.html</a> (accessed May 28, 2008).</span> Journalists often work on tight deadlines, and having the required information on hand could make the difference between whether a company is written about or not.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_p03">An online press room must have the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_l02">
        <li>Company history</li>
        <li>Key executive biographies</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Pitching to Bloggers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s02_p01">Although many journalists are bloggers, bloggers are not all journalists. They do not have to answer to their editor or publisher. They generally do not write to pay their bills; they tend to write about things that they are passionate about. They measure success in number of comments, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trackbacks</a><span class="glossdef">A mechanism used in a blog that shows a list of entries in other blogs that refer to a post on the first blog.</span></span>, and traffic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s02_p02">To pitch effectively to bloggers, you need to understand these subtleties. There are many useful blog posts by bloggers who get pitched too often that offer guidelines for the PR industry. The effective PR hack will take note.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s02_p03">As with journalists, building a relationship is the best way to pitch to a blogger. Remember, journalist or blogger, you are reaching out to an individual. To build a relationship, try the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>Read the blog and engage by commenting or responding.</li>
            <li>Make pitches personal and relevant.</li>
            <li>Provide accurate key information. Be descriptive but concise.</li>
            <li>Do not try to spin a story.</li>
            <li>Show you are aware of who is talking about you and who is talking about the blog.</li>
            <li>Be transparent.</li>
            <li>Provide links to images, logos, and press releases. Never send large attachments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s02_p04">In the United States, the beauty PR industry has been noticing the power of bloggers, and some of the cosmetics houses send samples and swag (an industry term for gifts) to bloggers as well as journalists.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-105454-fn11_007">Kayleen Schaefer, “Beauty Blogs Come of Age: Swag, Please!” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 31, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/fashion/31SKIN.html?ei=5088&amp;en=9e67baddbc42c4a5&amp;ex=1359435600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/fashion/31SKIN.html?ei=5088&amp;en= 9e67baddbc42c4a5&amp;ex=1359435600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all</a> (accessed May 28, 2008).</span> There is a difference, however. Journalists are generally restricted in the value of the gift they are allowed to accept and tend to reveal when reviewed products are free samples. The publishing houses need to maintain an unbiased reputation. Bloggers, however, are self-publishers and can make up their own rules as they go along. Some of them accept lavish gifts in return for coverage—coverage that can appear more authentic (even if it isn’t) as it comes from a blogger and not a journalist.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tools of the Trade</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_p01">WebPR is about engaging in a conversation, so the essential tools that are required are the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_l01">
            <li>Tools for listening</li>
            <li>Tools for responding</li>
            <li>Tools for tracking success</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_p02">RSS feeds tracking mentions of pertinent keywords are the best way to get an overview of mentions of a brand or company. These are outlined in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-105454-ch10#fwk-105454-ch10">Chapter 11 "Online Reputation Management"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_p03">Responding can take place through the various social media channels such as blogs, Twitter, and forums.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_p04">Online article directories and press-release directories are also crucial to publishing and spreading information. Having a thorough and up-to-date online newsroom ensures that relevant information is available.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s03_p05">The most important tool is relationship building. Whether with journalists, bloggers, or consumers, transparent conversations pave the way for effective public relations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">WebPR: Should I or Shouldn’t I?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s04_p01">There is no question about it: the media landscape has changed, and those who need to broadcast messages in the new media need to adapt along with it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s04_p02">The Internet allows for greater distribution and reach of all messages, but that means that companies can no longer control these messages in the ways that they used to. Public relations on the Web allows companies increased access to what their customers are saying and a direct channel to respond to that.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-105454-ch11_s05_s04_p03">Having so many new recipients of information requires more work from the PR team. As well as building relationships with journalists, you also need to include bloggers and other generators of content. The rules of engagement are changing, and power is increasingly moving from the companies who create messages to those that they need to broadcast it for them.</p>
